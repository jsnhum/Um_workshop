4,1,5,You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help,"This verse emphasizes the core principles of Islamic faith: worshipping Allah alone and seeking help only from Him. It teaches Muslims to devote all acts of worship solely to Allah and to rely on Him for assistance in all affairs, rejecting any form of polytheism or seeking help from false deities.",إياك نعبد وإياك نستعين

6,1,7,"The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.","The interpretation is that Allah is guiding the believers to follow the straight path, which is the path of those whom Allah has blessed with His favors, such as the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. This path is distinct from the path of those who have earned Allah's anger, like the disbelievers, and those who have gone astray, like the hypocrites and misguided people. It is a prayer to Allah to guide the believers to the path of truth and righteousness.",صراط الذين أنعمت عليهم غير المغضوب عليهم ولا الضالين
7,2,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim.","These are some of the unique, abbreviated letters (Al-Muqatta'aat) found at the beginning of certain chapters in the Qur'an. Their precise meanings are known only to Allah. However, scholars have offered interpretations suggesting they may serve as an introduction to draw attention to the divine origin of the Qur'an, or as an oath emphasizing the truthfulness of the revelations that follow.",الم
8,2,2,"That is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.","This verse affirms the divine origin and authority of the Qur'an, stating that it is a book free from any doubt or falsehood. It serves as a guide for those who have taqwa (consciousness of Allah), leading them to the straight path and providing them with wisdom and guidance in all aspects of life.",ذلك الكتاب لا ريب فيه هدى للمتقين
9,2,3,"Those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them","This verse describes the characteristics of the believers (al-mu'minun). They have faith in the unseen realities, such as Allah, the angels, the revealed books, and the Day of Judgment (""believe in the unseen""). They are steadfast in performing the obligatory prayers (""establish prayer""). And they spend from the provisions Allah has granted them in charitable ways (""spend out of what We have provided for them""). This verse highlights three essential qualities of true believers: faith, worship, and charity.",الذين يؤمنون بالغيب ويقيمون الصلاة ومما رزقناهم ينفقون
10,2,4,"And those who believe in what has been revealed to you [Muhammad] and what was revealed before you, and they are certain of the Hereafter.","This verse refers to the true believers who have faith in the Qur'an revealed to Prophet Muhammad, as well as the previous scriptures revealed to earlier Prophets.

12,2,6,"Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.","This verse indicates that those who have rejected faith and disbelieved in God and His revelations will not benefit from being warned or advised, as their hearts are sealed against guidance. Their stubborn rejection of the truth renders them unable to accept faith, regardless of the efforts made to guide them. Their disbelief has become entrenched, and no amount of warning or exhortation will change their stance. The interpretation emphasizes the futility of trying to convince those whose minds are closed to the message of truth.",إن الذين كفروا سواء عليهم أأنذرتهم أم لم تنذرهم لا يؤمنون
13,2,7,"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil.

14,2,8,"And among the people are those who say, 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day,' but they are not believers.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly profess belief in Allah and the Day of Resurrection, but their faith is merely lip service and not a sincere conviction.

True faith requires sincere belief accompanied by righteous deeds, which these hypocrites lack.",ومن الناس من يقول آمنا بالله وباليوم الآخر وما هم بمؤمنين
15,2,9,"They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves, though they perceive it not.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly profess faith but inwardly harbor disbelief and deception. They think they can fool Allah and the believers, but in reality, they are only deceiving themselves. Their deception is futile, as Allah knows what is in their hearts, and they are only harming themselves by adopting this hypocritical stance. The verse warns against such insincerity and self-deception, emphasizing the importance of having true faith and sincerity in one's beliefs and actions.",يخادعون الله والذين آمنوا وما يخدعون إلا أنفسهم وما يشعرون
16,2,10,"In their hearts is a disease, and Allah has increased them in disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they used to lie.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly professed faith but inwardly harbored doubts and disbelief. Their hearts were diseased with hypocrisy and denial of the truth. As a result of their persistent rejection of faith, Allah increased their spiritual sickness and misguidance. They will face a painful punishment in the Hereafter for their lies and false claims of belief.",في قلوبهم مرض فزادهم الله مرضا ولهم عذاب أليم بما كانوا يكذبون
17,2,11,"And when it is said to them, 'Do not cause corruption on the earth,' they say, 'We are but reformers.'","This verse refers to the hypocrites and wrongdoers who claim to be righteous and working for the betterment of society, when in reality their actions spread mischief and corruption on earth. They delude themselves into thinking that their misguided ways are justified and that they are ""reformers,"" while in truth, they are the opposite of what they claim to be.",وإذا قيل لهم لا تفسدوا في الأرض قالوا إنما نحن مصلحون
18,2,12,"Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they are not aware.","This verse highlights the irony of those who spread corruption and mischief on earth, yet they fail to recognize their own destructive behavior. It implies that their actions are driven by ignorance or a lack of self-awareness, causing them to remain oblivious to the harm they inflict upon themselves and others. The verse serves as a reminder to reflect on one's deeds and strive for righteousness, lest one becomes a source of corruption without even realizing it.",ألا إنهم هم المفسدون ولكن لا يشعرون
19,2,13,"And when it is said to them, ""Believe as the people have believed,"" they say, ""Should we believe as the foolish have believed?"" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they do not know.","This verse criticizes the arrogant attitude of those who refuse to believe despite clear evidence. They mock the believers, considering them foolish, while in reality it is they who lack understanding and wisdom. Their arrogance and closed-mindedness prevent them from recognizing the truth, even when it is presented to them clearly. The verse highlights the irony of their situation, where they consider themselves wise but are actually the foolish ones.",وإذا قيل لهم آمنوا كما آمن الناس قالوا أنؤمن كما آمن السفهاء ألا إنهم هم السفهاء ولكن لا يعلمون
20,2,14,"And when they meet those who believe, they say, ""We believe""; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, ""Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.""","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly profess faith when in the company of believers, but inwardly reject it and mock it when alone with their disbelieving associates.

21,2,15,"Allah mocks at them and prolongs them in their transgression, wandering blindly.","This verse suggests that Allah allows the disbelievers to persist in their arrogance and sinful ways, while they remain heedless and oblivious to the truth. Their continued defiance and rejection of faith is a form of mockery from Allah, as He gives them respite to indulge in their transgressions, yet they remain spiritually blind and lost in misguidance.",الله يستهزئ بهم ويمدهم في طغيانهم يعمهون
22,2,16,"Those are the ones who have bought error in exchange for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.","This verse refers to those who have chosen misguidance over the true guidance revealed by Allah. They have exchanged the truth for falsehood, and this ""trade"" has brought them no benefit or profit in the Hereafter. Instead of being rightly guided, they have gone astray due to their choice of disbelief over faith.",أولئك الذين اشتروا الضلالة بالهدى فما ربحت تجارتهم وما كانوا مهتدين
23,2,17,"Their example is like one who kindled a fire, and when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness, unable to see.","This verse compares the disbelievers to someone who lights a fire to gain light and warmth. However, as soon as the fire illuminates the surroundings, Allah takes away the light, leaving them in utter darkness, unable to perceive anything. This metaphor signifies that the disbelievers initially received guidance from Allah, but when they rejected it, Allah took away that light of guidance, leaving them in spiritual blindness and ignorance.",مثلهم كمثل الذي استوقد نارا فلما أضاءت ما حوله ذهب الله بنورهم وتركهم في ظلمات لا يبصرون
24,2,18,"Deaf, dumb, and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].","This verse describes the spiritual state of those who reject faith and guidance.

25,2,19,"Or [they are] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.","This verse uses a vivid metaphor to describe the state of the disbelievers when faced with the truth of Islam. They are likened to people caught in a terrifying rainstorm with darkness, thunder, and lightning. Just as people instinctively cover their ears to protect themselves from the deafening thunderclaps out of fear of death, the disbelievers reject the message of Islam and turn away from it due to their arrogance and stubbornness. However, Allah encompasses and has full knowledge of the disbelievers, and they cannot escape His plan and justice.",أو كصيب من السماء فيه ظلمات ورعد وبرق يجعلون أصابعهم في آذانهم من الصواعق حذر الموت والله محيط بالكافرين
26,2,20,"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","This verse describes the state of the disbelievers who are confused and unable to find the right path. The lightning symbolizes the brief moments of guidance that come to them, but they are unable to benefit from it due to their arrogance and stubbornness. When the light of guidance comes, they try to walk in it, but when it disappears, they stand still, unable to move forward. The verse emphasizes that Allah has complete power over their senses and could have taken them away if He willed, leaving them in complete darkness and confusion. It serves as a warning to those who reject faith and guidance.",يكاد البرق يخطف أبصارهم كلما أضاء لهم مشوا فيه وإذا أظلم عليهم قاموا ولو شاء الله لذهب بسمعهم وأبصارهم إن الله على كل شيء قدير
27,2,21,"O mankind! Worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.","This verse commands all people to worship and obey Allah alone, who created them and all the previous generations. The purpose of worshipping Allah is to attain righteousness and piety, which means having consciousness of Allah, following His commands, and avoiding His prohibitions.",يا أيها الناس اعبدوا ربكم الذي خلقكم والذين من قبلكم لعلكم تتقون
28,2,22,"It is He who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and has sent down water from the sky and thereby brought forth fruits for your sustenance. So do not set up rivals to Allah, while you know [there is nothing similar to Him].","Allah reminds us of His favors upon us by creating the earth as a resting place, the sky as a protective ceiling, and sending down rain to produce fruits for our sustenance. He warns us against associating partners with Him in worship, since we know that He is the sole Creator and Sustainer deserving of worship.",الذي جعل لكم الأرض فراشا والسماء بناء وأنزل من السماء ماء فأخرج به من الثمرات رزقا لكم فلا تجعلوا لله أندادا وأنتم تعلمون
29,2,23,"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.","This verse challenges the disbelievers to produce a chapter like the Qur'an if they doubt its divine origin. It emphasizes the inimitable nature of the Qur'an and that it is beyond human capability to produce something similar, even with the help of others besides Allah. This establishes the Qur'an as a miracle and proof of the truthfulness of Prophet Muhammad's message.",وإن كنتم في ريب مما نزلنا على عبدنا فأتوا بسورة من مثله وادعوا شهداءكم من دون الله إن كنتم صادقين
30,2,24,"But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.","If you do not believe in Allah's Oneness and obey His commands, which you will never be able to fulfill completely, then fear the punishment of Hellfire which is fueled by men and stones, and was prepared for those who disbelieve in Allah and reject His revelations.",فإن لم تفعلوا ولن تفعلوا فاتقوا النار التي وقودها الناس والحجارة أعدت للكافرين
31,2,25,"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, ""This is what we were provided with before,"" and it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","Cet verset promet aux croyants et à ceux qui font de bonnes œuvres qu'ils auront des jardins paradisiaques traversés par des rivières. Chaque fois qu'ils recevront des fruits de ces jardins, ils diront : ""C'est ce que nous avons déjà reçu auparavant"", car les fruits seront identiques à ceux qu'ils connaissaient sur Terre. Ils auront également des épouses pures et demeureront éternellement dans ce paradis.",وبشر الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات أن لهم جنات تجري من تحتها الأنهار كلما رزقوا منها من ثمرة رزقا قالوا هذا الذي رزقنا من قبل وأتوا به متشابها ولهم فيها أزواج مطهرة وهم فيها خالدون
32,2,26,"Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, 'What did Allah intend by this example?' He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient.",هذه الآية تبين أن الله تعالى لا يتحرج أو يستنكف من ضرب الأمثال، حتى لو كانت بأبسط المخلوقات كالبعوضة أو أصغر منها. والمؤمنون يدركون أن هذه الأمثال حق من الله وحكمة منه. أما الكافرون فيستهزئون بها ويقولون: ما الغرض من هذه الأمثال البسيطة؟ لكن الله بهذه الأمثال يضل من يريد ويهدي من يريد، ولا يضل بها إلا الفاسقين الخارجين عن طاعته.,إن الله لا يستحيي أن يضرب مثلا ما بعوضة فما فوقها فأما الذين آمنوا فيعلمون أنه الحق من ربهم وأما الذين كفروا فيقولون ماذا أراد الله بهذا مثلا يضل به كثيرا ويهدي به كثيرا وما يضل به إلا الفاسقين
33,2,27,"Those who break the covenant of Allah after its ratification, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption on earth - it is they who are the losers.","This verse refers to those who violate the covenants and commandments of Allah after affirming them. They sever the ties that Allah has ordained to be maintained, such as family relations and treaties. Moreover, they spread mischief and corruption on earth through their sinful actions. These individuals are ultimately the losers, as they have forsaken the path of righteousness and will face severe consequences in the Hereafter.",الذين ينقضون عهد الله من بعد ميثاقه ويقطعون ما أمر الله به أن يوصل ويفسدون في الأرض أولئك هم الخاسرون
34,2,28,"How can you disbelieve in Allah? You were dead and He gave you life. Then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.","This verse is reminding people of the clear signs of Allah's power and existence. It questions how one can deny Allah when He is the one who brought them to life after being lifeless, and will cause them to die and then resurrect them on the Day of Judgment. The cycle of life and death points to a greater reality beyond this world, where all will ultimately return to their Creator.",كيف تكفرون بالله وكنتم أمواتا فأحياكم ثم يميتكم ثم يحييكم ثم إليه ترجعون
35,2,29,"It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.","The interpretation is that Allah alone is the Creator of everything in the universe, including the earth and the seven heavens. He is All-Knowing and All-Aware of His creation. This verse highlights Allah's absolute power, knowledge, and authority over all that exists.",هو الذي خلق لكم ما في الأرض جميعا ثم استوى إلى السماء فسواهن سبع سماوات وهو بكل شيء عليم
36,2,30,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, ""Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority."" They said, ""Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we exalt You with praise and sanctify You?"" He said, ""Indeed, I know that which you do not know.""","Allah is stating that He will appoint a vicegerent, or khalifah, on earth who will have authority over it. The angels questioned this decision, wondering if this khalifah would cause corruption and bloodshed, while they praise and glorify Allah. Allah then responded that He has knowledge that the angels do not possess, implying that there is wisdom behind His decision to appoint a khalifah that the angels cannot comprehend.",وإذ قال ربك للملائكة إني جاعل في الأرض خليفة قالوا أتجعل فيها من يفسد فيها ويسفك الدماء ونحن نسبح بحمدك ونقدس لك قال إني أعلم ما لا تعلمون
37,2,31,"And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: ""Tell Me the names of these things if you are truthful.""","This verse highlights the superiority of knowledge bestowed upon Adam over the angels. God taught Adam the names and realities of all things, granting him a profound understanding. When God presented these named things to the angels and challenged them to name them, they were unable to do so, demonstrating that Adam's knowledge surpassed theirs. This verse affirms the honor and elevated status God granted to Adam through the blessing of knowledge.",وعلم آدم الأسماء كلها ثم عرضهم على الملائكة فقال أنبئوني بأسماء هؤلاء إن كنتم صادقين
38,2,32,"They said: ""Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us.

Allah then affirms His infinite knowledge, encompassing what is unseen as well as what is manifest, and what people reveal or conceal in their hearts.",قال يا آدم أنبئهم بأسمائهم فلما أنبأهم بأسمائهم قال ألم أقل لكم إني أعلم غيب السماوات والأرض وأعلم ما تبدون وما كنتم تكتمون
40,2,34,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam,' and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.","This verse refers to the event when Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam as a sign of respect and obedience, and all of them obeyed except Iblees (Satan).

42,2,36,"Then Satan made them slip from the (garden), and got them out from that in which they had been. And We said: ""Get you down, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.""","This verse refers to the story of Adam and Eve being tempted by Satan to eat from the forbidden tree in Paradise, leading to their expulsion from it. The interpretation is that Satan deceived them and caused them to disobey Allah's command, resulting in their removal from the blissful state they were in. Allah then decreed that they, along with their progeny, would live on Earth in a state of enmity and conflict with Satan, who is their eternal enemy. However, the Earth would also provide them with provisions and enjoyment for a temporary period until the appointed time of their return to Allah.",فأزلهما الشيطان عنها فأخرجهما مما كانا فيه وقلنا اهبطوا بعضكم لبعض عدو ولكم في الأرض مستقر ومتاع إلى حين

Indeed, it is He who is the Perpetual Acceptor of repentance, the Merciful.","This verse refers to the incident when Adam and Eve disobeyed Allah's command by eating from the forbidden tree in Paradise. After realizing their mistake, they repented sincerely to Allah. Allah then taught Adam certain words or prayers to seek forgiveness, which Adam recited.

44,2,38,"We said, ""Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.""","""This verse indicates that God commanded Adam, Eve, and Satan to descend from Paradise to the earth.

51,2,45,"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly obedient [to Allah].","This verse encourages believers to seek assistance and strength through patience and prayer, as these are powerful means to overcome difficulties and challenges. However, it acknowledges that maintaining patience and being consistent in prayer is indeed a great matter, except for those who are truly humble and submissive to Allah. The verse implies that those who have a deep sense of humility and fear of Allah will find it easier to persevere in patience and prayer, as they recognize their utter dependence on Allah and turn to Him sincerely.",واستعينوا بالصبر والصلاة وإنها لكبيرة إلا على الخاشعين
52,2,46,"Those who are certain that they will meet their Lord, and that they will return to Him.",This verse refers to the believers who have firm faith in the existence of God and the Day of Resurrection.

It reminds the believers of Allah's favor upon them by delivering them from Pharaoh's tyranny, which included killing their sons and sparing their women alive in a humiliating manner.

59,2,53,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion that you may be guided.",This verse refers to Allah bestowing upon Prophet Moses the Torah (the Scripture) and the Furqan (the Criterion to distinguish between right and wrong).

60,2,54,"And [recall] when Moses said to his people, ""O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.""

Moses admonished them for this grave sin and instructed them to repent sincerely by ""killing"" their egos and desires that led them to commit idolatry.

God then accepted their repentance, as He is Most Forgiving and Merciful.",وإذ قال موسى لقومه يا قوم إنكم ظلمتم أنفسكم باتخاذكم العجل فتوبوا إلى بارئكم فاقتلوا أنفسكم ذلكم خير لكم عند بارئكم فتاب عليكم إنه هو التواب الرحيم

Allah provided them with shade from the scorching heat through clouds, and nourished them with manna and quails as sustenance. However, despite these blessings, they were ungrateful and disobedient. Their wrongdoing did not harm Allah, but rather harmed themselves by depriving themselves of further blessings and incurring Allah's displeasure.",وظللنا عليكم الغمام وأنزلنا عليكم المن والسلوى كلوا من طيبات ما رزقناكم وما ظلمونا ولكن كانوا أنفسهم يظلمون

It promises forgiveness for their sins and an increase in reward for those who do good deeds. The interpretation emphasizes the importance of obedience, humility, and seeking forgiveness from God, as well as the promise of reward for righteous conduct.",وإذ قلنا ادخلوا هذه القرية فكلوا منها حيث شئتم رغدا وادخلوا الباب سجدا وقولوا حطة نغفر لكم خطاياكم وسنزيد المحسنين

He said, 'Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.' And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they used to disbelieve in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress.","This verse is a reminder of the ingratitude and lack of contentment shown by the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness after being liberated from slavery in Egypt. Despite witnessing God's miracles and provisions, they demanded a variety of foods instead of being grateful for the simple sustenance they received. Their lack of faith and obedience led to God's displeasure, resulting in humiliation, poverty, and anger upon them. The verse emphasizes the consequences of disbelief, disobedience, and transgression against God's commandments and signs.",وإذ قلتم يا موسى لن نصبر على طعام واحد فادع لنا ربك يخرج لنا مما تنبت الأرض من بقلها وقثائها وفومها وعدسها وبصلها قال أتستبدلون الذي هو أدنى بالذي هو خير اهبطوا مصرا فإن لكم ما سألتم وضربت عليهم الذلة والمسكنة وباءوا بغضب من الله ذلك بأنهم كانوا يكفرون بآيات الله ويقتلون النبيين بغير الحق ذلك بما عصوا وكانوا يعتدون

He raised the mountain over them as a warning and commanded them to adhere strictly to the Torah and its teachings.

The command to 'remember what is in it' is a call to reflect deeply on the teachings and injunctions contained within the Scripture, so that they may attain righteousness and become conscious of Allah.""",وإذ أخذنا ميثاقكم ورفعنا فوقكم الطور خذوا ما آتيناكم بقوة واذكروا ما فيه لعلكم تتقون

Allah uses this incident to illustrate His power to give life to the dead and revive nations. It serves as a sign of Allah's might and an invitation to ponder over the evidence of His existence and ability to resurrect on the Day of Judgment.

However, Allah mentions that not all stones are alike - some have rivers gushing from them, some split open allowing water to come out, and some fall down in awe and fear of Allah.

It serves as a reminder to have a humble and God-fearing heart, and not to be among those whose hearts are hardened and heedless of Allah's signs.",ثم قست قلوبكم من بعد ذلك فهي كالحجارة أو أشد قسوة وإن من الحجارة لما يتفجر منه الأنهار وإن منها لما يشقق فيخرج منه الماء وإن منها لما يهبط من خشية الله وما الله بغافل عما تعملون

84,2,78,"And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except for myths, and they do nothing but speculate.","This verse refers to the ignorant among the People of the Book who do not have true knowledge of their scriptures. They rely on myths, fables, and baseless assumptions rather than the actual teachings. Their beliefs are based on speculation and conjecture rather than facts and guidance from God.",ومنهم أميون لا يعلمون الكتاب إلا أماني وإن هم إلا يظنون

The Qur'an refutes this claim by stating that they have no covenant or promise from Allah regarding the duration of their punishment. It is a grave sin to make such claims about Allah without any knowledge or evidence. The verse emphasizes that Allah never breaks His promises, and warns against attributing false statements to Him out of ignorance.",وقالوا لن تمسنا النار إلا أياما معدودة قل أتخذتم عند الله عهدا فلن يخلف الله عهده أم تقولون على الله ما لا تعلمون

However, their unwillingness to do so exposes the falsehood of their claims and their lack of conviction in their beliefs.",قل إن كانت لكم الدار الآخرة عند الله خالصة من دون الناس فتمنوا الموت إن كنتم صادقين
101,2,95,"But they will never wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have sent ahead. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","This verse indicates that the disbelievers and wrongdoers will never wish for death or the Hereafter, no matter how difficult their situation becomes in this world. This is because they know that their evil deeds have preceded them, and they will face the consequences in the Hereafter. Allah is fully aware of those who commit injustice and wrongdoing, and they will be held accountable for their actions.",ولن يتمنوه أبدا بما قدمت أيديهم والله عليم بالظالمين
102,2,96,And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years. But it should not be that the grant of such life will save the disbeliever from the punishment. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.,"This verse highlights the intense desire of disbelievers to prolong their worldly life, even more than those who associate partners with Allah. It emphasizes their greed for a long life, to the extent that one of them wishes to live for a thousand years. However, the verse clarifies that this extended lifespan will not save them from the punishment of Allah. It serves as a reminder that Allah is fully aware of their actions and intentions.",ولتجدنهم أحرص الناس على حياة ومن الذين أشركوا يود أحدهم لو يعمر ألف سنة وما هو بمزحزحه من العذاب أن يعمر والله بصير بما يعملون
103,2,97,"Say, ""Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is he who has brought it down upon your heart, by Allah's permission, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.""","This verse affirms that the Qur'an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel, by the command of Allah. It confirms the truth of previous scriptures and serves as a guide and glad tidings for the believers. The interpretation emphasizes the divine origin of the Qur'an and its continuity with previous revelations, while also highlighting its role as a source of guidance and good news for the faithful.",قل من كان عدوا لجبريل فإنه نزله على قلبك بإذن الله مصدقا لما بين يديه وهدى وبشرى للمؤمنين
104,2,98,"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.","This verse warns against being an enemy or opponent to Allah, His angels who are His obedient servants, His messengers who conveyed His message, and the two great angels Gabriel and Michael. It declares that whoever takes such an enmity towards these beings, then Allah will be an enemy and opponent to them, which is a severe warning and threat. It emphasizes the importance of having faith and submission to Allah, His angels, and His messengers.",من كان عدوا لله وملائكته ورسله وجبريل وميكال فإن الله عدو للكافرين
105,2,99,"And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one disbelieves in them except the defiantly disobedient.","This verse implies that the Qur'anic verses are clear and self-evident proofs of their divine origin. Only those who are stubbornly rebellious and disobedient to Allah would reject or disbelieve them. The clarity and undeniable truth of the Qur'anic teachings leave no excuse for disbelief, except for those who willfully turn away from faith due to their own moral corruption and defiance.",ولقد أنزلنا إليك آيات بينات وما يكفر بها إلا الفاسقون
106,2,100,"Every time they made a covenant, a party of them cast it aside. In fact, most of them do not believe.","This verse criticizes the insincerity and lack of faith among those who repeatedly broke their covenants and agreements. It suggests that their actions stem from a fundamental disbelief or lack of true faith, as most of them do not genuinely believe in the principles they claim to uphold.",أوكلما عاهدوا عهدا نبذه فريق منهم بل أكثرهم لا يؤمنون
107,2,101,"And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming that which is with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.","This verse refers to the rejection of Prophet Muhammad's message by some Jews and Christians who had knowledge of previous scriptures foretelling his coming. Despite recognizing the truth, they arrogantly disregarded and turned away from the Qur'an, as if they were ignorant of the prophecies about the final Messenger of God.",ولما جاءهم رسول من عند الله مصدق لما معهم نبذ فريق من الذين أوتوا الكتاب كتاب الله وراء ظهورهم كأنهم لا يعلمون
108,2,102,"And they followed what the shayatin (devils) recited over the kingdom of Sulaiman (Solomon). And Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the shayatin disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was sent down upon the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut - although they did not teach anyone until they had said: 'We are only a trial, so do not disbelieve.' Yet they learned from them that by which they caused separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone with it except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them and did not profit them. And they certainly knew that he who buys it (sorcery) will have no share in the Hereafter. And indeed, evil is that for which they sold their souls, if they only knew.","This verse clarifies that Sulaiman (peace be upon him) was not involved in sorcery or disbelief. Rather, it was the devils who taught people sorcery and magic, which causes separation between spouses. The verse warns against learning and practicing sorcery, as it has no benefit in the Hereafter and is a means of harming oneself.",واتبعوا ما تتلو الشياطين على ملك سليمان وما كفر سليمان ولكن الشياطين كفروا يعلمون الناس السحر وما أنزل على الملكين ببابل هاروت وماروت وما يعلمان من أحد حتى يقولا إنما نحن فتنة فلا تكفر فيتعلمون منهما ما يفرقون به بين المرء وزوجه وما هم بضارين به من أحد إلا بإذن الله ويتعلمون ما يضرهم ولا ينفعهم ولقد علموا لمن اشتراه ما له في الآخرة من خلاق ولبئس ما شروا به أنفسهم لو كانوا يعلمون
109,2,103,"And if they had believed and feared Allah, then the reward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew.","This verse highlights the importance of faith (Iman) and God-consciousness (Taqwa). It implies that if the people had truly believed in Allah and His revelations, and had maintained a state of piety and righteousness, they would have attained a far greater reward from Allah than any worldly gains. However, their lack of understanding and spiritual insight prevents them from realizing the immense blessings that come with faith and God-consciousness.",ولو أنهم آمنوا واتقوا لمثوبة من عند الله خير لو كانوا يعلمون
110,2,104,O you who believe! Do not say 'Ra'ina' but say 'Unzurna' and listen. And for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment.,"This verse instructs the believers to avoid using the word ""Ra'ina"", which has a double meaning of obedience and disobedience in Hebrew. Instead, they should use the word ""Unzurna"", which means ""wait for us"" or ""give us time to understand"". This is to prevent any misunderstanding or disrespect towards the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The verse also warns the disbelievers of a painful punishment for their rejection of faith.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تقولوا راعنا وقولوا انظرنا واسمعوا وللكافرين عذاب أليم

And Allah is the possessor of great bounty.,"This verse indicates that the disbelievers, whether from the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) or the idolaters, do not desire any good or blessing to be bestowed upon the Muslims by Allah. However, Allah bestows His mercy and favors upon whomever He wills, and He is the One who possesses immense grace and bounty.",ما يود الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب ولا المشركين أن ينزل عليكم من خير من ربكم والله يختص برحمته من يشاء والله ذو الفضل العظيم

It affirms Allah's absolute authority and wisdom in legislating what is best for humanity at different times and circumstances. The abrogation of verses does not diminish the Qur'an's divine origin, but rather demonstrates Allah's perfect knowledge and ability to provide guidance that meets the evolving needs of people.",ما ننسخ من آية أو ننسها نأت بخير منها أو مثلها ألم تعلم أن الله على كل شيء قدير

It reminds us that we have no protector or helper besides Allah, so we should put our trust and reliance solely in Him.",ألم تعلم أن الله له ملك السماوات والأرض وما لكم من دون الله من ولي ولا نصير
114,2,108,Or do you intend to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the right way.,"This verse warns against questioning the Prophet Muhammad in the same way that the Israelites questioned Moses, which was out of stubbornness and disbelief. It also emphasizes that rejecting faith after having believed is a grave error that leads one astray from the straight path.",أم تريدون أن تسألوا رسولكم كما سئل موسى من قبل ومن يتبدل الكفر بالإيمان فقد ضل سواء السبيل

So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","This verse highlights the envy and resentment that some People of the Book (Jews and Christians) harbored towards the Muslim believers. Despite the truth being evident to them, their jealousy led them to wish that the Muslims would revert to disbelief. However, the Qur'an instructs the believers to pardon their ill-will, overlook their hostility, and remain patient until Allah's command is revealed, for He has power over all things.",ود كثير من أهل الكتاب لو يردونكم من بعد إيمانكم كفارا حسدا من عند أنفسهم من بعد ما تبين لهم الحق فاعفوا واصفحوا حتى يأتي الله بأمره إن الله على كل شيء قدير

It promises that any good deed done sincerely for the sake of Allah will be rewarded by Him, as He is All-Aware of our actions and intentions.",وأقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة وما تقدموا لأنفسكم من خير تجدوه عند الله إن الله بما تعملون بصير
117,2,111,"And they say, 'None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.' That is [merely] their wishful thinking. Say, 'Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.'","This verse refutes the claim of Jews and Christians that only their followers will attain Paradise. It challenges them to provide evidence for this assertion, as it is merely their desire and wishful thinking without any basis in truth. The verse emphasizes that salvation is not exclusive to any particular group, but rather depends on one's faith and righteous deeds, as per the guidance revealed by God.",وقالوا لن يدخل الجنة إلا من كان هودا أو نصارى تلك أمانيهم قل هاتوا برهانكم إن كنتم صادقين

Those who do not know speak words similar to theirs. God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their differences.","Allah is describing the enmity and disagreement between the Jews and Christians, despite both groups claiming to follow divine scripture. Their mutual rejection of each other's beliefs is based on ignorance. Allah states that He will settle this dispute on the Day of Judgment by judging between them regarding the matters they differed over.",وقالت اليهود ليست النصارى على شيء وقالت النصارى ليست اليهود على شيء وهم يتلون الكتاب كذلك قال الذين لا يعلمون مثل قولهم فالله يحكم بينهم يوم القيامة فيما كانوا فيه يختلفون

As a reward, Allah promised to make him a leader for humanity.

The believers should dedicate their worship purely and sincerely to Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him.""",قل أتحاجوننا في الله وهو ربنا وربكم ولنا أعمالنا ولكم أعمالكم ونحن له مخلصون
146,2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, ""Are you more knowing or is Allah?"" And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.","This verse questions the claim of Jews and Christians that the Prophets Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve tribes were followers of their respective religions. It rhetorically asks if they are more knowledgeable than Allah about the religion of these Prophets. It condemns those who conceal the truth about the religion of these Prophets, which is the pure monotheistic faith of Islam, as a great injustice. The verse asserts that Allah is fully aware of their actions and beliefs.",أم تقولون إن إبراهيم وإسماعيل وإسحاق ويعقوب والأسباط كانوا هودا أو نصارى قل أأنتم أعلم أم الله ومن أظلم ممن كتم شهادة عنده من الله وما الله بغافل عما تعملون
147,2,141,"That is a nation which has passed away. Theirs is that which they earned, and yours is that which you earn. And you will not be asked about what they used to do.","This verse emphasizes the principle of individual accountability before God. Each person is responsible for their own deeds and will be judged accordingly on the Day of Resurrection. The actions and beliefs of previous nations or individuals will not affect one's own judgment. One cannot rely on the faith or good deeds of others, nor will one be held accountable for the misdeeds of others. The emphasis is on personal responsibility and the consequences of one's choices and actions.",تلك أمة قد خلت لها ما كسبت ولكم ما كسبتم ولا تسألون عما كانوا يعملون
148,2,142,"The foolish among the people will say, 'What has turned them away from their qiblah which they used to face?' Say, 'To Allah belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.'","This verse addresses the change of qiblah (direction of prayer) from Jerusalem to the Ka'bah in Makkah. The ""foolish"" ones questioned this change, but Allah reminds that He is the Owner and Lord of all directions, and He guides whomever He wills to the straight path. The change of qiblah was a test of faith for the believers to follow Allah's command without questioning.",سيقول السفهاء من الناس ما ولاهم عن قبلتهم التي كانوا عليها قل لله المشرق والمغرب يهدي من يشاء إلى صراط مستقيم
149,2,143,"And thus We have made you a moderate community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who follows the Messenger from who turns back on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful.","Allah made the Muslim community a moderate and justly balanced nation to serve as witnesses over humanity on the Day of Judgment, while the Prophet Muhammad will be a witness over them. The change of the qiblah (direction of prayer) from Jerusalem to the Ka'bah in Makkah was a test to distinguish those who sincerely follow the Prophet from those who turn back on their faith. This change, though difficult, was easy for those guided by Allah. He would never let their faith go to waste, for He is Most Kind and Merciful to humanity.",وكذلك جعلناكم أمة وسطا لتكونوا شهداء على الناس ويكون الرسول عليكم شهيدا وما جعلنا القبلة التي كنت عليها إلا لنعلم من يتبع الرسول ممن ينقلب على عقبيه وإن كانت لكبيرة إلا على الذين هدى الله وما كان الله ليضيع إيمانكم إن الله بالناس لرءوف رحيم
150,2,144,"We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.","This verse refers to the changing of the qiblah (direction faced in prayer) from Jerusalem to the Ka'bah in Makkah. Allah says that He has seen the Prophet's desire to face the Ka'bah during prayer, and that He will fulfill this wish. The believers are commanded to face the Sacred Mosque in Makkah wherever they are during prayer. The People of the Book know that this command is the truth from their Lord, and Allah is aware of their deeds.",قد نرى تقلب وجهك في السماء فلنولينك قبلة ترضاها فول وجهك شطر المسجد الحرام وحيث ما كنتم فولوا وجوهكم شطره وإن الذين أوتوا الكتاب ليعلمون أنه الحق من ربهم وما الله بغافل عما يعملون
151,2,145,"And even if you were to bring to those who were given the Book every sign, they would not follow your qiblah, nor would you be a follower of their qiblah. Nor would they be followers of one another's qiblah. And if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would then be among the wrongdoers.","This verse emphasizes the futility of trying to please everyone, especially those who have deviated from the truth. It teaches that one should adhere to the guidance received from God, regardless of the opposition or desires of others. Following the whims of people after receiving divine knowledge is considered a form of wrongdoing. The verse encourages steadfastness in following the truth and not compromising one's principles to appease others.",ولئن أتيت الذين أوتوا الكتاب بكل آية ما تبعوا قبلتك وما أنت بتابع قبلتهم وما بعضهم بتابع قبلة بعض ولئن اتبعت أهواءهم من بعد ما جاءك من العلم إنك إذا لمن الظالمين

But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it.","This verse refers to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who recognize the truth of the Qur'an and the prophethood of Muhammad, just as they recognize their own sons. However, some of them deliberately conceal this truth out of envy, arrogance, or desire to maintain their position and status, even though they are fully aware of the truth.",الذين آتيناهم الكتاب يعرفونه كما يعرفون أبناءهم وإن فريقا منهم ليكتمون الحق وهم يعلمون

154,2,148,"And for every nation there is a direction to which they turn their faces; so strive to be foremost in good deeds. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together. Surely, Allah has power over all things.","This verse emphasizes that each nation or community has its own direction or way of life, but the ultimate goal should be to compete in doing good deeds and righteous actions. No matter where a person is located, Allah will gather all people together on the Day of Judgment. The verse reminds us of Allah's absolute power and ability to bring about the resurrection and recompense for everyone's deeds.",ولكل وجهة هو موليها فاستبقوا الخيرات أين ما تكونوا يأت بكم الله جميعا إن الله على كل شيء قدير

And [it is] so I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided.","This verse instructs Muslims to face the direction of the Kaaba in Makkah during their prayers, no matter where they are in the world. It establishes the qiblah (direction of prayer) as a unifying symbol for Muslims. The verse also states that only wrongdoers will object to this command, and Muslims should not fear them but fear Allah alone. It emphasizes that this command is part of Allah's favor upon the believers to guide them to the right path.",ومن حيث خرجت فول وجهك شطر المسجد الحرام وحيث ما كنتم فولوا وجوهكم شطره لئلا يكون للناس عليكم حجة إلا الذين ظلموا منهم فلا تخشوهم واخشوني ولأتم نعمتي عليكم ولعلكم تهتدون
157,2,151,As We have sent among you a Messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know.,"This verse highlights the role of the Prophet Muhammad as a teacher and guide sent by Allah to the people. He recited the verses of the Qur'an, purified their souls from evil and ignorance, taught them the divine scripture (the Qur'an) and wisdom, and imparted knowledge they did not previously possess. The Prophet's mission was to elevate the spiritual, moral, and intellectual state of the people.",كما أرسلنا فيكم رسولا منكم يتلو عليكم آياتنا ويزكيكم ويعلمكم الكتاب والحكمة ويعلمكم ما لم تكونوا تعلمون

160,2,154,"And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah, 'They are dead.' Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive.","This verse emphasizes that those who sacrifice their lives for the cause of Allah are not truly dead, but rather alive in the eyes of Allah. Their souls continue to live on, though we may not comprehend this reality with our limited human perception.

Le verset encourage à faire preuve de piété et de bienfaisance envers les pauvres, tout en soulignant l'importance du jeûne pour les musulmans en bonne santé.",أياما معدودات فمن كان منكم مريضا أو على سفر فعدة من أيام أخر وعلى الذين يطيقونه فدية طعام مسكين فمن تطوع خيرا فهو خير له وأن تصوموا خير لكم إن كنتم تعلمون
191,2,185,"The month of Ramadan is that in which the Qur'an was revealed, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion. So whoever of you sights the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.","Allah decreed fasting in Ramadan as an act of worship and obedience to Him, to develop God-consciousness and self-restraint. It is a means of spiritual purification and an opportunity to express gratitude for the guidance of the Qur'an. The concessions for travelers and the ill reflect Allah's mercy and ease in religious obligations.",شهر رمضان الذي أنزل فيه القرآن هدى للناس وبينات من الهدى والفرقان فمن شهد منكم الشهر فليصمه ومن كان مريضا أو على سفر فعدة من أيام أخر يريد الله بكم اليسر ولا يريد بكم العسر ولتكملوا العدة ولتكبروا الله على ما هداكم ولعلكم تشكرون

193,2,187,"On the night of the fasts it is permitted for you to go in unto your wives. They are as a garment for you and you are as a garment for them. Allah is aware that you have been betraying yourselves, so He has turned towards you and pardoned you. Now you can lie with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct from the black thread of the dawn. Then resume the fast until night and do not touch them while you are in retreat in the mosques. Those are the limits set by Allah, so do not come near them. Thus does Allah make clear His revelations to the people, that they may guard themselves against evil.","Allah permits intimacy between spouses during the nights of fasting, as they are a source of comfort and protection for each other. He is aware of the difficulties people face in abstaining from desires, so He pardons them and allows them to seek intimacy at night. However, they must stop intimacy at dawn and resume fasting until night. This verse establishes the boundaries of permissible behavior during fasting and emphasizes the importance of following Allah's commands to attain piety.",أحل لكم ليلة الصيام الرفث إلى نسائكم هن لباس لكم وأنتم لباس لهن علم الله أنكم كنتم تختانون أنفسكم فتاب عليكم وعفا عنكم فالآن باشروهن وابتغوا ما كتب الله لكم وكلوا واشربوا حتى يتبين لكم الخيط الأبيض من الخيط الأسود من الفجر ثم أتموا الصيام إلى الليل ولا تباشروهن وأنتم عاكفون في المساجد تلك حدود الله فلا تقربوها كذلك يبين الله آياته للناس لعلهم يتقون

It warns against giving bribes to rulers or officials to gain an unfair advantage or to wrongfully consume others' wealth. Such actions are considered sinful and a violation of Islamic principles of justice and fairness.",ولا تأكلوا أموالكم بينكم بالباطل وتدلوا بها إلى الحكام لتأكلوا فريقا من أموال الناس بالإثم وأنتم تعلمون
195,2,189,"They ask you about the new moons. Say, 'They are measures of time for the people and for Hajj.' And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back; but righteousness is [in] one who fears Allah. And enter houses from their doors. And fear Allah that you may succeed.","This verse is addressing questions about the significance of the new moons. It states that the new moons mark the timings for various practices and rituals, including the Hajj pilgrimage. However, righteousness is not defined by superficial actions like entering houses from the back. True righteousness comes from having consciousness of Allah and fearing Him. The verse instructs people to enter houses through their proper doors as a metaphor for following the right path ordained by Allah in order to attain success and salvation.",يسألونك عن الأهلة قل هي مواقيت للناس والحج وليس البر بأن تأتوا البيوت من ظهورها ولكن البر من اتقى وأتوا البيوت من أبوابها واتقوا الله لعلكم تفلحون

Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.","This verse is referring to a specific historical context of fighting against the pagan Meccans who had expelled Muslims from their homes. It allows defensive fighting against the aggressors, but prohibits initiating hostilities at the sacred mosque in Mecca. The interpretation emphasizes that this is not a blanket command for violence, but a contextual permission for self-defense against persecution and oppression. The ""fitnah"" mentioned is the oppression and persecution inflicted on believers for their faith.",واقتلوهم حيث ثقفتموهم وأخرجوهم من حيث أخرجوكم والفتنة أشد من القتل ولا تقاتلوهم عند المسجد الحرام حتى يقاتلوكم فيه فإن قاتلوكم فاقتلوهم كذلك جزاء الكافرين

If anyone aggresses against you, you may aggress against them to an equal extent, and be mindful of God, and know that God is with the God-revering.","This verse establishes the principle of proportional retaliation in the case of violations committed during the sacred months. It allows Muslims to reciprocate against aggressors to the same degree, but no more. However, it also reminds believers to maintain consciousness of God and act with restraint, as God is with those who are mindful of Him.",الشهر الحرام بالشهر الحرام والحرمات قصاص فمن اعتدى عليكم فاعتدوا عليه بمثل ما اعتدى عليكم واتقوا الله واعلموا أن الله مع المتقين

And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.","This verse encourages spending and giving in the cause of Allah, which includes all good deeds and acts of worship. It also prohibits destructive behavior that could lead to harm or ruin.

This is for those whose family does not reside near al-Masjid al-Haraam. And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in penalty.","This verse outlines the rites and obligations of Hajj and 'Umrah. It instructs the believers to complete these rituals for the sake of Allah. If they are prevented from doing so due to circumstances beyond their control, they should offer a sacrificial animal if possible. If they cannot afford it, they should fast, give charity, or offer a sacrifice as an alternative. The verse also covers the rules regarding shaving one's head during Hajj and the penalties for violating these rules. It emphasizes the importance of fearing Allah and being mindful of His severe punishment for those who disobey His commands.",وأتموا الحج والعمرة لله فإن أحصرتم فما استيسر من الهدي ولا تحلقوا رءوسكم حتى يبلغ الهدي محله فمن كان منكم مريضا أو به أذى من رأسه ففدية من صيام أو صدقة أو نسك فإذا أمنتم فمن تمتع بالعمرة إلى الحج فما استيسر من الهدي فمن لم يجد فصيام ثلاثة أيام في الحج وسبعة إذا رجعتم تلك عشرة كاملة ذلك لمن لم يكن أهله حاضري المسجد الحرام واتقوا الله واعلموا أن الله شديد العقاب

It tells them that there is no sin in seeking provision and bounties from Allah during Hajj. After they leave 'Arafat, which is a key ritual in Hajj, they should remember Allah and glorify Him at al-Mash'ar al-Haraam, which is a sacred place.

It gives the husband the right to approach his wife in whatever manner he desires, as long as it is through the proper means (i.e. vaginal intercourse). However, it also reminds believers to fear Allah, do good deeds, and keep in mind that they will be accountable to Him. The last part gives glad tidings to the believers.",نساؤكم حرث لكم فأتوا حرثكم أنى شئتم وقدموا لأنفسكم واتقوا الله واعلموا أنكم ملاقوه وبشر المؤمنين

232,2,226,"For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months, but if they go back, then indeed Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","""This verse refers to the practice of 'ila' in pre-Islamic times, where a husband would take an oath to avoid intimacy with his wife. Islam limited this practice to a maximum of four months, after which the husband must either revoke his oath and resume marital relations, or proceed with an irrevocable divorce. The verse highlights Allah's mercy by allowing the revocation of such oaths without penalty.""",للذين يؤلون من نسائهم تربص أربعة أشهر فإن فاءوا فإن الله غفور رحيم

234,2,228,"Divorced women must wait for three monthly periods before remarrying, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have the better right to take them back during this period, if they desire reconciliation.

And Allah is Mighty, Wise.","This verse outlines the waiting period ('iddah) for divorced women, which is three menstrual cycles. During this time, they cannot conceal their pregnancy if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their former husbands have the right to take them back if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to what is expected of them, but men have a degree over them in responsibilities. This reflects the wisdom and might of Allah.",والمطلقات يتربصن بأنفسهن ثلاثة قروء ولا يحل لهن أن يكتمن ما خلق الله في أرحامهن إن كن يؤمن بالله واليوم الآخر وبعولتهن أحق بردهن في ذلك إن أرادوا إصلاحا ولهن مثل الذي عليهن بالمعروف وللرجال عليهن درجة والله عزيز حكيم
235,2,229,"Divorce is twice, then [there must be] either an acceptable retention or a release with kindness. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them, unless both fear that they will not maintain the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not maintain the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning what she ransoms herself with. These are the limits of Allah, so do not transgress them, and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers.","L'interprétation de ce verset est que le divorce n'est permis que deux fois, après quoi le mari doit soit retenir son épouse de manière convenable, soit la libérer avec bonté. Il n'a pas le droit de reprendre ce qu'il lui a donné, sauf si les deux craignent de ne pas pouvoir respecter les lois d'Allah. Dans ce cas, la femme peut se racheter en rendant une partie de sa dot.

Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they think they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits of Allah, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge.","This verse outlines the conditions under which a divorced couple can remarry each other. If a man divorces his wife for the third time, she cannot remarry him until she marries another man and that marriage is consummated and then dissolved. If she marries another man and he divorces her, then she and her first husband can remarry without any sin, as long as they believe they can uphold the limits set by Allah. The verse emphasizes the importance of respecting Allah's limits and provides guidance for those who understand the wisdom behind these laws.",فإن طلقها فلا تحل له من بعد حتى تنكح زوجا غيره فإن طلقها فلا جناح عليهما أن يتراجعا إن ظنا أن يقيما حدود الله وتلك حدود الله يبينها لقوم يعلمون

It emphasizes the importance of being righteous in either retaining or releasing them, and warns against harming or oppressing them out of spite. It also reminds believers not to mock Allah's verses and to be grateful for His favors, the Qur'an, and the wisdom He has bestowed upon them. The verse concludes by urging the fear of Allah and reminding that He is Ever-Aware of all things.",وإذا طلقتم النساء فبلغن أجلهن فأمسكوهن بمعروف أو سرحوهن بمعروف ولا تمسكوهن ضرارا لتعتدوا ومن يفعل ذلك فقد ظلم نفسه ولا تتخذوا آيات الله هزوا واذكروا نعمت الله عليكم وما أنزل عليكم من الكتاب والحكمة يعظكم به واتقوا الله واعلموا أن الله بكل شيء عليم

It emphasizes the importance of facilitating reconciliation between divorced spouses, as this is virtuous and pure in the sight of Allah. The verse reminds believers of their faith in Allah and the Last Day, encouraging them to follow this guidance for the sake of their spiritual well-being. It also highlights Allah's supreme knowledge, contrasting it with human ignorance.",وإذا طلقتم النساء فبلغن أجلهن فلا تعضلوهن أن ينكحن أزواجهن إذا تراضوا بينهم بالمعروف ذلك يوعظ به من كان منكم يؤمن بالله واليوم الآخر ذلكم أزكى لكم وأطهر والله يعلم وأنتم لا تعلمون

It emphasizes the importance of mutual consultation, fairness, and moderation in fulfilling these duties, while recognizing that no one should be overburdened beyond their capacity.

And know that Allah knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.","This verse is addressing the issue of proposing marriage to women. It states that there is no sin in indirectly hinting at the desire to marry a woman or keeping such intentions to oneself, as Allah knows what is in people's hearts. However, one should not make a secret commitment or contract with the woman, except through proper and honorable means. Additionally, the marriage should not be formalized until the prescribed waiting period (e.g., for a widow or divorced woman) has ended. The verse reminds believers that Allah is aware of their innermost thoughts and intentions, so they should be mindful of Him and His commands. It also highlights Allah's attributes of being Oft-Forgiving and Most Forbearing.",ولا جناح عليكم فيما عرضتم به من خطبة النساء أو أكننتم في أنفسكم علم الله أنكم ستذكرونهن ولكن لا تواعدوهن سرا إلا أن تقولوا قولا معروفا ولا تعزموا عقدة النكاح حتى يبلغ الكتاب أجله واعلموا أن الله يعلم ما في أنفسكم فاحذروه واعلموا أن الله غفور حليم

Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing.","This verse discusses the case of divorce before consummation of marriage. It instructs that if a man divorces his wife before intimate relations, and he had already assigned a dowry (mahr) for her, he must give her half of the specified dowry.

The verse encourages forgoing the dowry as an act of righteousness and reminds believers to maintain graciousness and kindness towards each other, as Allah is All-Aware of their deeds.",وإن طلقتموهن من قبل أن تمسوهن وقد فرضتم لهن فريضة فنصف ما فرضتم إلا أن يعفون أو يعفو الذي بيده عقدة النكاح وأن تعفوا أقرب للتقوى ولا تنسوا الفضل بينكم إن الله بما تعملون بصير

It instructs that if a man passes away leaving a wife behind, she is entitled to be provided with housing and maintenance for one year after his death. However, if she chooses to leave the residence of her own accord before the year is over, then there is no sin upon the heirs for not providing for her beyond that point, as long as she is treated fairly and her rights are fulfilled. This ruling reflects Allah's wisdom in upholding justice and protecting the rights of widows.",والذين يتوفون منكم ويذرون أزواجا وصية لأزواجهم متاعا إلى الحول غير إخراج فإن خرجن فلا جناح عليكم في ما فعلن في أنفسهن من معروف والله عزيز حكيم

This provision is considered a right of the divorced wife and a duty upon the righteous, God-fearing husbands. The provision should be given ""according to what is reasonable,"" meaning it should be commensurate with the husband's financial means and the wife's standard of living during the marriage.",وللمطلقات متاع بالمعروف حقا على المتقين

Allah commanded them to die, and they died. Then Allah brought them back to life to show His power and grace. It teaches that Allah has control over life and death, and that He bestows favors upon people, but most are ungrateful for His blessings.",ألم تر إلى الذين خرجوا من ديارهم وهم ألوف حذر الموت فقال لهم الله موتوا ثم أحياهم إن الله لذو فضل على الناس ولكن أكثر الناس لا يشكرون

However, it emphasizes that this struggle should be undertaken with the awareness that Allah is All-Hearing, listening to every word and intention, and All-Knowing, aware of every action and circumstance. This awareness should instill a sense of accountability and sincerity in the believers, ensuring that their motives and actions align with the principles of Islam and the pleasure of Allah.",وقاتلوا في سبيل الله واعلموا أن الله سميع عليم

But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers.","This verse refers to an incident involving the Children of Israel after the time of Prophet Moses. They asked one of their prophets to appoint a king for them so they could fight in the way of Allah. However, when fighting was prescribed for them, most of them turned away from it, except for a few. The interpretation highlights their initial enthusiasm to fight for the cause of Allah, but their lack of commitment when actually called upon to fight. It serves as a lesson on the importance of steadfastness and fulfilling one's promises, and Allah's knowledge of those who act wrongfully.",ألم تر إلى الملإ من بني إسرائيل من بعد موسى إذ قالوا لنبي لهم ابعث لنا ملكا نقاتل في سبيل الله قال هل عسيتم إن كتب عليكم القتال ألا تقاتلوا قالوا وما لنا ألا نقاتل في سبيل الله وقد أخرجنا من ديارنا وأبنائنا فلما كتب عليهم القتال تولوا إلا قليلا منهم والله عليم بالظالمين

He said, 'Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favor] and All-Knowing.'","This verse describes the reaction of the Israelites when their prophet informed them that Allah had appointed Saul as their king. They questioned his worthiness, citing their own superiority and Saul's lack of wealth. However, the prophet explained that Allah had chosen Saul based on his knowledge and physical stature, emphasizing that Allah bestows sovereignty upon whomever He wills, as He is All-Knowing and All-Encompassing in His wisdom.",وقال لهم نبيهم إن الله قد بعث لكم طالوت ملكا قالوا أنى يكون له الملك علينا ونحن أحق بالملك منه ولم يؤت سعة من المال قال إن الله اصطفاه عليكم وزاده بسطة في العلم والجسم والله يؤتي ملكه من يشاء والله واسع عليم

Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.'","Cette interprétation souligne que le signe de la royauté du prophète était l'arrivée de l'Arche d'alliance, contenant la sécurité et la tranquillité de Dieu ainsi que les reliques laissées par Moïse et Aaron. L'Arche, portée par les anges, était une preuve évidente de la véracité du prophète pour ceux qui avaient la foi.",وقال لهم نبيهم إن آية ملكه أن يأتيكم التابوت فيه سكينة من ربكم وبقية مما ترك آل موسى وآل هارون تحمله الملائكة إن في ذلك لآية لكم إن كنتم مؤمنين

Whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it is indeed with me, except for whoever scoops up a little with his hand.' But they drank from it, except a few of them. And when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, they said: 'We have no power this day against Jalut and his soldiers.' But those who were certain that they would meet Allah said: 'How many a small company has overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave! And Allah is with the patient.'","This verse describes a test that Allah put the believers through under the leadership of Prophet Talut (Saul). The river was a means to distinguish the truly faithful from those who lacked determination. Those who drank from the river excessively failed the test, while those who exercised restraint by taking only a handful of water passed. When faced with the mighty army of Jalut (Goliath), the believers were divided into two groups: those who feared defeat, and those who had firm faith in Allah's help and remained steadfast. The latter group reminded the former that with Allah's aid, a small force can overcome a much larger enemy. The verse emphasizes the importance of patience, restraint, and unwavering faith in the face of adversity.",فلما فصل طالوت بالجنود قال إن الله مبتليكم بنهر فمن شرب منه فليس مني ومن لم يطعمه فإنه مني إلا من اغترف غرفة بيده فشربوا منه إلا قليلا منهم فلما جاوزه هو والذين آمنوا معه قالوا لا طاقة لنا اليوم بجالوت وجنوده قال الذين يظنون أنهم ملاقو الله كم من فئة قليلة غلبت فئة كثيرة بإذن الله والله مع الصابرين

Pour out constancy on us and make our footsteps firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.'","This verse refers to the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines, led by Goliath. The Israelites prayed to Allah to grant them patience, steadfastness, and victory over the disbelieving Philistines. It teaches us to put our trust in Allah and seek His help in times of difficulty and adversity.",ولما برزوا لجالوت وجنوده قالوا ربنا أفرغ علينا صبرا وثبت أقدامنا وانصرنا على القوم الكافرين
257,2,251,"So they defeated them by Allah's permission, and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingship and wisdom, and taught him from what He willed.

It also mentions that Allah bestowed upon David kingship, wisdom, and knowledge according to His will. The verse further states that if Allah did not repel some people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted with injustice and oppression. However, Allah is Gracious and Merciful towards all the worlds, maintaining balance and order through His divine wisdom.",فهزموهم بإذن الله وقتل داوود جالوت وآتاه الله الملك والحكمة وعلمه مما يشاء ولولا دفع الله الناس بعضهم ببعض لفسدت الأرض ولكن الله ذو فضل على العالمين

But they differed - some believed while others disbelieved. Yet had Allah willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does whatever He desires.","This verse highlights the exalted status of the messengers and prophets, and that Allah favored some over others. It mentions that Jesus, son of Mary, was given clear signs and miracles, and was supported by the holy spirit. The verse then states that if Allah had willed, the people after the prophets would not have differed and fought among themselves despite receiving clear revelations. However, they differed, with some believing and others disbelieving. Ultimately, Allah does as He wills, and had He willed, they would not have fought.",تلك الرسل فضلنا بعضهم على بعض منهم من كلم الله ورفع بعضهم درجات وآتينا عيسى ابن مريم البينات وأيدناه بروح القدس ولو شاء الله ما اقتتل الذين من بعدهم من بعد ما جاءتهم البينات ولكن اختلفوا فمنهم من آمن ومنهم من كفر ولو شاء الله ما اقتتلوا ولكن الله يفعل ما يريد

On that Day, there will be no opportunity to engage in trade or business to earn more wealth, no close relationships or friendships that could benefit anyone, and no intercession that could rescue the disbelievers from Allah's punishment. The disbelievers are the true wrongdoers for rejecting faith and failing to spend in Allah's cause.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا أنفقوا مما رزقناكم من قبل أن يأتي يوم لا بيع فيه ولا خلة ولا شفاعة والكافرون هم الظالمون

It emphasizes that He is unlike His creation, free from any need for sleep or rest. Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him, and no one can intercede with Him except by His permission. His knowledge encompasses all things, and nothing is hidden from Him. His authority and dominion extend over the heavens and the earth, yet their preservation does not burden Him in the least.

Allah guides the believers from the darkness of ignorance, misguidance, and disbelief to the light of faith, knowledge, and righteousness. However, the disbelievers follow false deities and are led from the light of truth to the darkness of falsehood and error. The verse emphasizes that the ultimate destination of the disbelievers is the Hellfire, where they will abide forever, while the believers will attain salvation under Allah's protection.",الله ولي الذين آمنوا يخرجهم من الظلمات إلى النور والذين كفروا أولياؤهم الطاغوت يخرجونهم من النور إلى الظلمات أولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون

When Abraham pointed out that it is Allah who gives life and causes death, the king arrogantly claimed to have the same power. Abraham then challenged him to bring the sun from the west if he truly had such power, which left the disbeliever speechless and unable to respond. The verse emphasizes that Allah alone has supreme power and authority, and that He does not guide those who persist in wrongdoing and disbelief.",ألم تر إلى الذي حاج إبراهيم في ربه أن آتاه الله الملك إذ قال إبراهيم ربي الذي يحيي ويميت قال أنا أحيي وأميت قال إبراهيم فإن الله يأتي بالشمس من المشرق فأت بها من المغرب فبهت الذي كفر والله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين
265,2,259,"Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, 'How will Allah bring this to life after its death?' So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, 'How long have you remained?' He replied, 'I have remained a day or part of a day.' He said, 'Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and drink - it has not spoiled, but look at your donkey. And We have made you a sign for the people. And look at the bones - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh.' And when it became clear to him, he said, 'I know that Allah is over all things competent.'","This verse presents an example of Allah's power to resurrect the dead. A man passed by a ruined town and doubted how Allah could revive it after its destruction. Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then revived him. When he awoke, he thought he had been dead for only a day or part of a day, but Allah showed him signs that he had been dead for a century: his food and drink were unspoiled, his donkey had decayed, and Allah showed him how bones can be reassembled and covered with flesh. This example demonstrates Allah's ability to bring the dead back to life on the Day of Resurrection.",أو كالذي مر على قرية وهي خاوية على عروشها قال أنى يحيي هذه الله بعد موتها فأماته الله مائة عام ثم بعثه قال كم لبثت قال لبثت يوما أو بعض يوم قال بل لبثت مائة عام فانظر إلى طعامك وشرابك لم يتسنه وانظر إلى حمارك ولنجعلك آية للناس وانظر إلى العظام كيف ننشزها ثم نكسوها لحما فلما تبين له قال أعلم أن الله على كل شيء قدير
266,2,260,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said, ""My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead."" [Allah] said, ""Have you not believed?"" He said, ""Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied."" [Allah] said, ""Take four birds and commit them to yourself. Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.""","Cette verse décrit l'épisode où le prophète Abraham demanda à Dieu de lui montrer comment Il redonne vie aux morts. Bien qu'Abraham croyait déjà en Dieu, il voulait avoir une preuve tangible pour apaiser son cœur. Dieu lui ordonna alors de prendre quatre oiseaux, de les tuer et de disperser leurs morceaux sur différentes collines. Puis, quand Abraham les appela, les oiseaux revinrent à la vie et volèrent vers lui. Ceci fut un signe de la puissance et de la sagesse de Dieu pour ressusciter les morts le Jour du Jugement.",وإذ قال إبراهيم رب أرني كيف تحيي الموتى قال أولم تؤمن قال بلى ولكن ليطمئن قلبي قال فخذ أربعة من الطير فصرهن إليك ثم اجعل على كل جبل منهن جزءا ثم ادعهن يأتينك سعيا واعلم أن الله عزيز حكيم
267,2,261,"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed which grows seven spikes, in each spike there are one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.","This verse uses a parable to illustrate the immense rewards awaiting those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah. Their act of spending is likened to a seed that produces seven ears of grain, each containing a hundred grains. This represents the manifold increase in reward that Allah bestows upon the charitable. The verse emphasizes Allah's power to multiply rewards without limit for whomever He wills, as He is Infinite and All-Knowing.",مثل الذين ينفقون أموالهم في سبيل الله كمثل حبة أنبتت سبع سنابل في كل سنبلة مائة حبة والله يضاعف لمن يشاء والله واسع عليم
268,2,262,"Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders of it or [other] injury, for them is their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","This verse is praising those who spend their wealth for the sake of Allah without expecting anything in return, whether it be gratitude or praise from others. Their reward is with Allah, and they will have no fear or grief on the Day of Judgment.",الذين ينفقون أموالهم في سبيل الله ثم لا يتبعون ما أنفقوا منا ولا أذى لهم أجرهم عند ربهم ولا خوف عليهم ولا هم يحزنون
269,2,263,Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Free of need and Forbearing.,"This verse emphasizes the importance of treating others with kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. It suggests that offering kind words and forgiving others is superior to giving charity while causing harm or offense. The verse also highlights that Allah is Self-Sufficient and does not need our charity, and that He is Forbearing and pardons our shortcomings.",قول معروف ومغفرة خير من صدقة يتبعها أذى والله غني حليم
270,2,264,"O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as one who spends his wealth only to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example is like that of a smooth rock upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare. They are unable [to keep] anything of what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.","This verse warns believers not to nullify their charitable deeds by reminding the recipients of their favors or hurting them. It likens the one who spends wealth only to show off and does not believe in Allah and the Hereafter to a smooth rock covered with dust that is washed away by rain, leaving it bare. Such people will not benefit from their deeds in the Hereafter, and Allah does not guide the disbelievers.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تبطلوا صدقاتكم بالمن والأذى كالذي ينفق ماله رئاء الناس ولا يؤمن بالله واليوم الآخر فمثله كمثل صفوان عليه تراب فأصابه وابل فتركه صلدا لا يقدرون على شيء مما كسبوا والله لا يهدي القوم الكافرين
271,2,265,"And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah and assuring their souls is like a garden on a high ground which is hit by a downpour, so it yields its fruit twofold. And if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle [is sufficient]. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.","This verse uses the parable of a fertile garden to illustrate the reward for those who spend their wealth sincerely for the sake of pleasing Allah and strengthening their faith. Just as a garden on elevated land benefits greatly from rain, whether heavy or light, those who spend in Allah's cause will be abundantly rewarded, regardless of how much they give. Their reward is multiplied manifold by Allah's grace, and He is fully aware of their intentions and deeds.",ومثل الذين ينفقون أموالهم ابتغاء مرضات الله وتثبيتا من أنفسهم كمثل جنة بربوة أصابها وابل فآتت أكلها ضعفين فإن لم يصبها وابل فطل والله بما تعملون بصير
272,2,266,"Would one of you wish to have a garden of date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, with all kinds of fruits for him therein, and he is afflicted with old age and has weak offspring, then it is struck by a whirlwind containing fire, so it gets burnt? Thus does Allah make the signs clear for you, that you may reflect.","This verse uses a parable to illustrate the transient nature of worldly possessions and pleasures. It describes a person who has a lush garden with rivers, fruits, and offspring, but then old age strikes, rendering the offspring weak. Then a fiery whirlwind destroys the garden. This parable teaches that no matter how prosperous one may be in this life, everything is temporary and can be taken away suddenly. The verse encourages reflection on the impermanence of worldly things and the importance of focusing on the Hereafter.",أيود أحدكم أن تكون له جنة من نخيل وأعناب تجري من تحتها الأنهار له فيها من كل الثمرات وأصابه الكبر وله ذرية ضعفاء فأصابها إعصار فيه نار فاحترقت كذلك يبين الله لكم الآيات لعلكم تتفكرون
273,2,267,"O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have earned, and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it save if you closed your eyes to it. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, Worthy of all praise.","This verse instructs the believers to spend from the good and pure things they have earned through lawful means, and from the pure and wholesome provisions that Allah has produced from the earth. It prohibits them from intending to give away impure, harmful, or worthless things in charity, which they themselves would not accept except by closing their eyes to its defects. It reminds them that Allah is Self-Sufficient, not in need of their charity, and Worthy of all praise for His bounties.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا أنفقوا من طيبات ما كسبتم ومما أخرجنا لكم من الأرض ولا تيمموا الخبيث منه تنفقون ولستم بآخذيه إلا أن تغمضوا فيه واعلموا أن الله غني حميد
274,2,268,"Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is All-Encompassing and All-Knowing.","This verse contrasts the promises of Satan with those of Allah. Satan tries to mislead people by threatening them with poverty and tempting them towards immorality. On the other hand, Allah promises forgiveness for sins and abundant provision for those who follow His guidance. The verse emphasizes that Allah's knowledge and bounties are vast, unlike Satan's deception and false promises.",الشيطان يعدكم الفقر ويأمركم بالفحشاء والله يعدكم مغفرة منه وفضلا والله واسع عليم
275,2,269,"He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.","Allah bestows wisdom, which is the ability to comprehend the truth and act accordingly, upon whomever He wills from among His servants. Whoever is granted this wisdom has indeed been blessed with an immense good. However, only those who possess sound intellect and understanding truly benefit from this wisdom and take heed of its lessons.",يؤتي الحكمة من يشاء ومن يؤت الحكمة فقد أوتي خيرا كثيرا وما يذكر إلا أولو الألباب
276,2,270,"And whatever you spend for sustenance or whatever you vow as a vow, indeed Allah knows it. And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.","This verse emphasizes that Allah is fully aware of all our expenditures and vows. It encourages spending in His cause and fulfilling our vows, as nothing is hidden from Him. Additionally, it warns that those who commit wrongdoings will find no helpers or protectors on the Day of Judgment.",وما أنفقتم من نفقة أو نذرتم من نذر فإن الله يعلمه وما للظالمين من أنصار
277,2,271,"If you disclose your charitable expenditures, that is well, but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds [thereby]. And Allah, with what you do, is All-Acquainted.","This verse highlights the virtue of giving charity secretly. While public charity is permissible, concealing one's charitable acts and giving directly to the needy is superior and more rewarding. It purifies the giver from sins and misdeeds. Ultimately, Allah is fully aware of all our actions, whether done publicly or privately.",إن تبدوا الصدقات فنعما هي وإن تخفوها وتؤتوها الفقراء فهو خير لكم ويكفر عنكم من سيئاتكم والله بما تعملون خبير
278,2,272,"Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever good you [believers] spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seeking the Countenance of Allah. And whatever you spend of good - it will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.","Cette interprétation souligne que le Prophète n'est pas responsable de guider les gens vers la foi, car c'est Allah qui guide qui Il veut. Elle encourage également les croyants à dépenser leurs richesses dans de bonnes causes, non pas pour être vus des autres, mais pour chercher l'agrément d'Allah. Allah promet de récompenser pleinement ces dépenses charitables, sans que les croyants ne soient lésés.",ليس عليك هداهم ولكن الله يهدي من يشاء وما تنفقوا من خير فلأنفسكم وما تنفقون إلا ابتغاء وجه الله وما تنفقوا من خير يوف إليكم وأنتم لا تظلمون

You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not ask people imploringly. And whatever good you spend, Allah is truly Aware of it.","This verse refers to a category of poor people who are unable to travel and earn a living due to being engaged in the cause of Allah. They are too dignified to beg, so an ignorant person may assume they are wealthy. Allah advises recognizing them by their modest appearance and not their words, and spending on them, for He is fully Aware of such good deeds.",للفقراء الذين أحصروا في سبيل الله لا يستطيعون ضربا في الأرض يحسبهم الجاهل أغنياء من التعفف تعرفهم بسيماهم لا يسألون الناس إلحافا وما تنفقوا من خير فإن الله به عليم
280,2,274,"Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately and publicly, they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.","This verse encourages spending in the way of Allah, whether openly or secretly, day or night. Those who give charitably out of their wealth with sincerity will be rewarded by Allah, and they will have no fear of the future or grief over what has passed.",الذين ينفقون أموالهم بالليل والنهار سرا وعلانية فلهم أجرهم عند ربهم ولا خوف عليهم ولا هم يحزنون
281,2,275,"Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade is [just] like interest.' But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns [to dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.","Cette verse condamne fermement l'intérêt usuraire (riba) et le compare à la folie provoquée par Satan. Elle établit une distinction claire entre le commerce licite et l'intérêt illicite. Ceux qui persistent dans la pratique de l'intérêt après avoir été avertis seront voués au châtiment éternel de l'Enfer. En revanche, ceux qui s'abstiennent de l'intérêt après avoir reçu l'avertissement divin seront pardonnés pour leurs péchés passés, et leur sort relèvera de la miséricorde d'Allah.",الذين يأكلون الربا لا يقومون إلا كما يقوم الذي يتخبطه الشيطان من المس ذلك بأنهم قالوا إنما البيع مثل الربا وأحل الله البيع وحرم الربا فمن جاءه موعظة من ربه فانتهى فله ما سلف وأمره إلى الله ومن عاد فأولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون
282,2,276,Allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allah does not like every ungrateful sinner.,"This verse highlights the contrasting consequences of interest (riba) and charity (sadaqat). Interest, which involves exploiting others for personal gain, is condemned and will be destroyed by Allah. On the other hand, charity, which involves giving selflessly to others, is praised and will be multiplied by Allah. The verse also emphasizes that Allah does not love those who are ungrateful disbelievers and persist in sinful ways.",يمحق الله الربا ويربي الصدقات والله لا يحب كل كفار أثيم
283,2,277,"Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and established prayer and given zakah will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.","This verse promises a great reward for those who have faith in Allah and do good deeds, which include establishing regular prayer and paying the obligatory charity (zakah).

284,2,278,"O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.","This verse commands the believers to have taqwa (consciousness and fear) of Allah and to completely abandon dealing with interest or usury (riba) if they are truly believers. It emphasizes the incompatibility of faith and interest-based transactions, as interest exploits others and promotes injustice. The verse calls for a complete rejection of the interest-based economic system and a transition towards an interest-free economy based on principles of fairness and mutual benefit.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا اتقوا الله وذروا ما بقي من الربا إن كنتم مؤمنين
285,2,279,"But if you do not do it, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you shall have your principal amounts, you shall not wrong nor shall you be wronged.","This verse warns those who deal in usury (interest-based transactions) that if they persist in this practice, they will be at war with Allah and His Messenger. However, if they repent and abandon this unlawful practice, they will not be punished for past transactions, and their principal amounts will be returned to them without any injustice or oppression.",فإن لم تفعلوا فأذنوا بحرب من الله ورسوله وإن تبتم فلكم رءوس أموالكم لا تظلمون ولا تظلمون

And if you give charity, it is better for you, if you only knew.","This verse encourages creditors to show patience and leniency towards debtors facing financial difficulties. It advises granting them an extension or deferment until their circumstances improve, making it easier for them to repay their debts. Additionally, it promotes the virtue of giving charity willingly, as it is beneficial for the giver, both in this life and the Hereafter, if they truly understand the wisdom behind it.",وإن كان ذو عسرة فنظرة إلى ميسرة وأن تصدقوا خير لكم إن كنتم تعلمون
287,2,281,"And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah.

It emphasizes the importance of honesty, justice, and accountability in financial dealings, and urges debtors to fulfill their obligations completely without diminishing anything. The verse also provides guidance on the proper procedures for recording debts, including the use of scribes and witnesses.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا تداينتم بدين إلى أجل مسمى فاكتبوه وليكتب بينكم كاتب بالعدل ولا يأب كاتب أن يكتب كما علمه الله فليكتب وليملل الذي عليه الحق وليتق الله ربه ولا يبخس منه شيئا فإن كان الذي عليه الحق سفيها أو ضعيفا أو لا يستطيع أن يمل هو فليملل وليه بالعدل واستشهدوا شهيدين من رجالكم فإن لم يكونا رجلين فرجل وامرأتان ممن ترضون من الشهداء أن تضل إحداهما فتذكر إحداهما الأخرى ولا يأب الشهداء إذا ما دعوا ولا تسأموا أن تكتبوه صغيرا أو كبيرا إلى أجله ذلكم أقسط عند الله وأقوم للشهادة وأدنى ألا ترتابوا إلا أن تكون تجارة حاضرة تديرونها بينكم فليس عليكم جناح ألا تكتبوها وأشهدوا إذا تبايعتم ولا يضار كاتب ولا شهيد وإن تفعلوا فإنه فسوق بكم واتقوا الله ويعلمكم الله والله بكل شيء عليم

It invites those who argue against him to gather with their families and the Prophet's family, and earnestly pray to God to curse the liars among them. This 'mutual cursing' would reveal who is truthful and who is lying, as God would not allow the truthful party to be cursed. The verse demonstrates the Prophet's confidence in his message and his willingness to put his life and family at stake to prove its truth.",فمن حاجك فيه من بعد ما جاءك من العلم فقل تعالوا ندع أبناءنا وأبناءكم ونساءنا ونساءكم وأنفسنا وأنفسكم ثم نبتهل فنجعل لعنت الله على الكاذبين
354,3,62,"Indeed, this is the true narrative, and there is no deity except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","This verse affirms the truthfulness and authenticity of the stories mentioned in the Qur'an, emphasizing that they are not mere fables or legends. It also establishes the fundamental Islamic belief in the Oneness of God (Tawhid) by declaring that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. Additionally, it highlights two of Allah's sublime attributes: Al-'Azeez (the Exalted in Might) and Al-Hakeem (the Wise), indicating His absolute power and perfect wisdom in all His actions and decrees.",إن هذا لهو القصص الحق وما من إله إلا الله وإن الله لهو العزيز الحكيم
355,3,63,"But if they turn away, then indeed Allah is Aware of the corrupters.","If the disbelievers persist in their rejection and corruption, Allah is fully aware of their evil deeds and intentions, and He will hold them accountable. This verse serves as a warning that their actions do not go unnoticed by Allah, who has perfect knowledge of all things.",فإن تولوا فإن الله عليم بالمفسدين
356,3,64,"Say, ""O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah."" But if they turn away, then say, ""Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].""","This verse calls for unity between Muslims and People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) on the fundamental principle of worshipping One God alone and not associating partners with Him. It urges them to abandon the worship of anything besides Allah and not take religious leaders as lords besides Allah. If they reject this call, Muslims are instructed to bear witness that they have submitted themselves to Allah alone.",قل يا أهل الكتاب تعالوا إلى كلمة سواء بيننا وبينكم ألا نعبد إلا الله ولا نشرك به شيئا ولا يتخذ بعضنا بعضا أربابا من دون الله فإن تولوا فقولوا اشهدوا بأنا مسلمون
357,3,65,"O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason?","This verse questions the reasoning of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) for arguing about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were revealed after his time. It implies that they should use their intellect and understand that Abraham lived before the revelation of their scriptures, and therefore, their arguments about him lack a proper basis.",يا أهل الكتاب لم تحاجون في إبراهيم وما أنزلت التوراة والإنجيل إلا من بعده أفلا تعقلون
358,3,66,"Here you are - you have disputed about what you have [some] knowledge of, but why do you dispute about what you have no knowledge of? And Allah knows, while you know not.","This verse admonishes those who argue about matters they have no knowledge of. It emphasizes that we should refrain from debating or disputing topics that are beyond our understanding, as Allah alone possesses complete knowledge. It encourages humility and reliance on divine wisdom rather than making baseless claims or engaging in fruitless arguments about the unknown.",ها أنتم هؤلاء حاججتم فيما لكم به علم فلم تحاجون فيما ليس لكم به علم والله يعلم وأنتم لا تعلمون
359,3,67,"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was an upright man, a Muslim, and he was not one of the polytheists.","This verse emphasizes that Prophet Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but rather a monotheist who submitted himself completely to the One God (""hanif"" and ""muslim""). He rejected all forms of polytheism and idol worship. This verse establishes that the religion of Islam, which calls for pure monotheism and submission to God, is the original religion of Abraham, and not an innovation.",ما كان إبراهيم يهوديا ولا نصرانيا ولكن كان حنيفا مسلما وما كان من المشركين
360,3,68,"Indeed, the closest of people to Abraham are those who followed him and this prophet, and those who believe. And Allah is the ally of the believers.","This verse highlights the spiritual connection between Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), his followers, and the followers of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him). It emphasizes that the true inheritors of Abraham's legacy are those who follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and have faith in Allah.

361,3,69,"A party of the People of the Book wish they could mislead you, but they only mislead themselves, and they do not perceive it.","This verse refers to some people from the previous scriptures, such as Jews and Christians, who wished to lead the Muslims astray from their faith. However, their attempts to mislead the believers would only harm themselves, as they would be the ones deviating from the truth. They were unaware of the consequences of their actions, blinded by their own prejudices and desires.",ودت طائفة من أهل الكتاب لو يضلونكم وما يضلون إلا أنفسهم وما يشعرون
362,3,70,"O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah while you witness [to their truth]?","This verse is questioning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) as to why they reject the signs and revelations of Allah when they themselves are witnesses to their truth.

363,3,71,"O People of the Scripture, why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?","This verse condemns the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) for deliberately mixing truth with falsehood and concealing the truth about the prophethood of Muhammad, despite having knowledge of it from their own scriptures. It criticizes their dishonest behavior of distorting religious teachings for worldly gains or to maintain their position of authority.",يا أهل الكتاب لم تلبسون الحق بالباطل وتكتمون الحق وأنتم تعلمون
364,3,72,"And a faction of the People of the Scripture said, 'Believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end, that perhaps they will abandon their religion.'","This verse refers to a deceitful tactic employed by some People of the Book (Jews and Christians) against the Muslims. They would pretend to believe in the Qur'an in the morning but reject it by the evening, hoping that the Muslims would become confused and abandon their faith. This shows the extent of their opposition and dishonesty towards the truth revealed in the Qur'an.",وقالت طائفة من أهل الكتاب آمنوا بالذي أنزل على الذين آمنوا وجه النهار واكفروا آخره لعلهم يرجعون
365,3,73,"And do not believe except for those who follow your religion.

Say, ""Indeed, the bounty is in the hand of Allah - He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Wise.""","This verse instructs the believers not to trust or have faith in anyone except those who follow their religion (Islam). It emphasizes that true guidance comes from Allah alone, and anyone who receives guidance similar to what the believers have received should not be a cause for doubt or argument. The verse reminds that Allah's bounty and favor are bestowed upon whomever He wills, and He is All-Encompassing and Wise in His decisions.",ولا تؤمنوا إلا لمن تبع دينكم قل إن الهدى هدى الله أن يؤتى أحد مثل ما أوتيتم أو يحاجوكم عند ربكم قل إن الفضل بيد الله يؤتيه من يشاء والله واسع عليم
366,3,74,"He bestows His mercy upon whom He wills, and Allah is the Possessor of great bounty.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty and His infinite mercy. It means that Allah bestows His mercy and favors upon whomever He wills, according to His divine wisdom and justice. No one can dictate or impose conditions on Allah's mercy, for He is the ""Possessor of great bounty,"" whose grace and blessings are boundless and beyond human comprehension.",يختص برحمته من يشاء والله ذو الفضل العظيم

And they speak an untruth about Allah while they know [it].","This verse criticizes the dishonest behavior of some People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and their false claim that they are not accountable for cheating the ""unlettered"" (non-Jews and non-Christians). It exposes their hypocrisy of claiming to follow divine scripture while lying and betraying trusts. The verse condemns their double standards and dishonesty towards Muslims, whom they considered ""unlettered"".",ومن أهل الكتاب من إن تأمنه بقنطار يؤده إليك ومنهم من إن تأمنه بدينار لا يؤده إليك إلا ما دمت عليه قائما ذلك بأنهم قالوا ليس علينا في الأميين سبيل ويقولون على الله الكذب وهم يعلمون

It warns that such people will be deprived of any reward in the Hereafter.

Would he command you with disbelief after you were Muslims?,"This verse emphasizes the core Islamic belief in the Oneness of God (Tawheed) and rejects associating partners with Him. It refutes the notion that God would command people to worship angels or prophets as deities, as this would contradict the fundamental teachings of Islam and lead to disbelief (kufr) after having accepted the faith. The verse affirms that true Islam does not permit the worship of any beings other than the One God.",ولا يأمركم أن تتخذوا الملائكة والنبيين أربابا أيأمركم بالكفر بعد إذ أنتم مسلمون

He said, ""Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.""","This verse refers to the covenant that Allah took from all the Prophets, that whenever a new Prophet comes confirming the previous Scriptures and teachings, they must believe in him and support him.

It declares that anyone who consciously rejects Islam and seeks a different way of life will be considered a loser in the Hereafter. The verse highlights the importance of embracing Islam wholeheartedly and rejecting any alternative paths that contradict its teachings.,ومن يبتغ غير الإسلام دينا فلن يقبل منه وهو في الآخرة من الخاسرين

The door to Allah's forgiveness is always open for those who genuinely seek it through repentance and reform. This verse instills hope and encourages people to turn back to the right path, as Allah is both Forgiving and Merciful to those who repent.",إلا الذين تابوا من بعد ذلك وأصلحوا فإن الله غفور رحيم
382,3,90,"Indeed, those who disbelieved after their belief and then increased in disbelief - never will their repentance be accepted, and it is those who are truly astray.","This verse refers to those who initially embraced faith but later rejected it and increased in their disbelief.

384,3,92,"You will never attain righteousness until you spend from what you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.","This verse emphasizes the importance of spending in the way of Allah from what is most beloved to a person.

So follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate others with Allah.""","This verse commands the Prophet Muhammad to declare that Allah has spoken the truth, and to follow the upright religion of Abraham, who was a monotheist and did not associate any partners with Allah.

It reminds believers of the favor Allah bestowed upon them by guiding them to the truth and uniting their hearts after being enemies.

However, the verse also critiques the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) for their lack of belief, stating that if they had truly believed, it would have been better for them. While acknowledging that some among them are believers, the verse condemns most of them as disobedient transgressors.",كنتم خير أمة أخرجت للناس تأمرون بالمعروف وتنهون عن المنكر وتؤمنون بالله ولو آمن أهل الكتاب لكان خيرا لهم منهم المؤمنون وأكثرهم الفاسقون
403,3,111,"They will not harm you except for some annoyance; and if they fight you, they will turn their backs to you, then they will not be helped.","This verse indicates that the disbelievers' attempts to harm the believers will be insignificant and ineffective. Even if they engage in combat, they will ultimately flee in defeat and find no assistance or support. This emphasizes the weakness and futility of the disbelievers' opposition to the truth and the divine support granted to the believers.",لن يضروكم إلا أذى وإن يقاتلوكم يولوكم الأدبار ثم لا ينصرون
404,3,112,"Debasement has been struck upon them wherever they are encountered, except with a rope from Allah and a rope from the people, and they became deserving of wrath from Allah, and destitution was struck upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve in the signs of Allah and kill the prophets without right. That is because they disobeyed and used to transgress.","This verse describes the humiliation and misery that befell the disbelievers among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) as a punishment for their rejection of Allah's signs, killing of prophets unjustly, disobedience, and transgression. They were debased and faced disgrace wherever they went, except for those who held onto a covenant with Allah or a treaty with the believers. They earned Allah's wrath and lived in poverty due to their disbelief, oppression, and violations.",ضربت عليهم الذلة أين ما ثقفوا إلا بحبل من الله وحبل من الناس وباءوا بغضب من الله وضربت عليهم المسكنة ذلك بأنهم كانوا يكفرون بآيات الله ويقتلون الأنبياء بغير حق ذلك بما عصوا وكانوا يعتدون
405,3,113,"Not all of the People of the Book are alike. There is an upright community among them who recite God's revelations throughout the night, bowing down in worship.","This verse highlights the diversity among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). It states that there is a group among them who are upright and sincere in their faith. They devote themselves to reciting and studying God's revelations, even during the night, and they prostrate themselves in worship. This indicates their sincerity, humility, and commitment to their faith. The verse implies that not all People of the Book are misguided or astray, and that there are those who truly follow the teachings of their scriptures.",ليسوا سواء من أهل الكتاب أمة قائمة يتلون آيات الله آناء الليل وهم يسجدون
406,3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and hasten to do good deeds. And those are among the righteous.","This verse highlights the key characteristics of righteous believers. They have faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment, promote virtuous conduct and discourage evil, and eagerly engage in good deeds. These qualities define them as among the truly righteous people.",يؤمنون بالله واليوم الآخر ويأمرون بالمعروف وينهون عن المنكر ويسارعون في الخيرات وأولئك من الصالحين
407,3,115,"And whatever good they do, never will it be rejected from them. And Allah is All-Aware of the pious.","This verse signifies that any righteous deed performed by a believer, no matter how small, will be accepted and rewarded by Allah. It emphasizes Allah's knowledge of those who have taqwa (consciousness of Allah) and strive to obey Him. The implication is that one should not underestimate the value of good actions, as Allah recognizes and appreciates even the smallest efforts made sincerely for His sake.",وما يفعلوا من خير فلن يكفروه والله عليم بالمتقين
408,3,116,"Indeed, those who disbelieve - never will their wealth or their children avail them against Allah at all. And it is they who are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","This verse emphasizes that material wealth and offspring will be of no benefit to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment. Their riches and progeny, which they took pride in during their worldly life, will not help them against Allah's punishment or ransom them from the Hellfire. Rather, they will be the eternal dwellers of Hell, suffering its torment forever as a consequence of their disbelief and rejection of faith.",إن الذين كفروا لن تغني عنهم أموالهم ولا أولادهم من الله شيئا وأولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون
409,3,117,"The example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and destroys it. And Allah has not wronged them, but they wrong themselves.","This verse compares the deeds and wealth spent by disbelievers in this life to a cold, destructive wind that ruins the crops of people who have wronged themselves by disbelieving. Their efforts are in vain and bring no lasting benefit, just as the crops are destroyed. Allah does not wrong them; rather, they wrong themselves by rejecting faith and doing deeds that bear no fruit.",مثل ما ينفقون في هذه الحياة الدنيا كمثل ريح فيها صر أصابت حرث قوم ظلموا أنفسهم فأهلكته وما ظلمهم الله ولكن أنفسهم يظلمون
410,3,118,"O you who believe! Do not take as intimates those other than your own people; they will spare no pains to corrupt you; they wish you to suffer. Hatred has already been revealed from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still. We have made the Signs plain for you if you will understand.","This verse warns the believers against taking non-believers as close companions or confidants, as they harbor enmity towards the believers and wish to see them suffer. Their hatred is evident from their speech, and their hearts conceal even greater malice. Allah has made His signs and guidance clear, if only the believers use their intellect to understand.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تتخذوا بطانة من دونكم لا يألونكم خبالا ودوا ما عنتم قد بدت البغضاء من أفواههم وما تخفي صدورهم أكبر قد بينا لكم الآيات إن كنتم تعقلون

But when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage. Say, 'Die in your rage. Allah is truly Aware of what is in the hearts.'","This verse addresses the hypocritical behavior of some people towards the believers. It criticizes those who claim to believe when meeting the believers, but harbor hatred and rage towards them in private. The interpretation highlights Allah's knowledge of the true intentions in people's hearts, despite their outward claims of faith. It advises the believers to remain steadfast in their belief and not be swayed by the hypocrites' rage and resentment.",ها أنتم أولاء تحبونهم ولا يحبونكم وتؤمنون بالكتاب كله وإذا لقوكم قالوا آمنا وإذا خلوا عضوا عليكم الأنامل من الغيظ قل موتوا بغيظكم إن الله عليم بذات الصدور

Yet if you remain patient and God-fearing, their plots cannot harm you at all; for God encompasses whatever they do.","This verse speaks of the attitude of the disbelievers towards the believers. If good befalls the believers, the disbelievers are grieved by it, but if any harm or misfortune afflicts the believers, the disbelievers rejoice over it. However, the verse advises the believers to be patient and God-fearing, for if they do so, the plots and schemes of the disbelievers cannot harm them in any way. This is because Allah encompasses and has full knowledge of all their actions and plots.",إن تمسسكم حسنة تسؤهم وإن تصبكم سيئة يفرحوا بها وإن تصبروا وتتقوا لا يضركم كيدهم شيئا إن الله بما يعملون محيط
413,3,121,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when you set out from your family in the morning to position the believers for the battle - and Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","This verse refers to the Battle of Uhud, when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was positioning and arranging the Muslim army for the impending battle against the Quraysh. It highlights Allah's knowledge and awareness of the situation, as He is ""Hearing and Knowing"" of all that transpires.",وإذ غدوت من أهلك تبوئ المؤمنين مقاعد للقتال والله سميع عليم
414,3,122,"When two parties among you were about to lose courage, but Allah was their protector; and upon Allah the believers should put their trust.","This verse refers to the Battle of Uhud, when a group of Muslim fighters disobeyed the Prophet's orders and left their positions, which led to a temporary setback. However, Allah was their protector and supporter. The lesson is that true believers should put their trust in Allah alone, even in difficult circumstances.",إذ همت طائفتان منكم أن تفشلا والله وليهما وعلى الله فليتوكل المؤمنون
415,3,123,"And indeed, Allah gave you victory at Badr while you were weak. So fear Allah, that you may be grateful.","This verse reminds the believers of Allah's favor upon them when He granted them victory at the Battle of Badr, despite their weakness and small numbers compared to the disbelievers. It encourages them to maintain piety and gratitude towards Allah for His help and support.",ولقد نصركم الله ببدر وأنتم أذلة فاتقوا الله لعلكم تشكرون
416,3,124,"When you said to the believers, 'Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?'","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reassured the believers that Allah would send down angels to support them, despite their small number and lack of resources compared to the disbelieving army.

417,3,125,"Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of Allah, and they come upon you at once, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks [of distinction].","This verse encourages believers to be patient, have taqwa (consciousness of Allah), and remain steadfast in the face of adversity. If they do so and the enemy attacks them suddenly, Allah promises to aid them with 5,000 angels who are distinctly marked. This divine assistance is a reward for their faith and perseverance, and a manifestation of Allah's power to support His believing servants against their enemies.",بلى إن تصبروا وتتقوا ويأتوكم من فورهم هذا يمددكم ربكم بخمسة آلاف من الملائكة مسومين
418,3,126,"And Allah made it not but good tidings for you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","This verse emphasizes that the dream or vision mentioned earlier was a glad tiding from Allah to reassure the believers and strengthen their hearts. It also reminds them that true victory comes only from Allah, Who is Almighty and Wise in His decisions and plans.",وما جعله الله إلا بشرى لكم ولتطمئن قلوبكم به وما النصر إلا من عند الله العزيز الحكيم
419,3,127,"That He may cut off a portion of those who disbelieve, or suppress them so that they turn back, frustrated.","This verse suggests that one of Allah's purposes in allowing battles and wars is to weaken and defeat the disbelievers, either by killing some of them or by suppressing their power and influence. This would lead them to retreat in a state of disappointment and failure, realizing the futility of their opposition to the truth.",ليقطع طرفا من الذين كفروا أو يكبتهم فينقلبوا خائبين
420,3,128,"Not for you is the command at all; whether He should forgive them, or punish them, for indeed they are the wrongdoers.","This verse indicates that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had no authority or control over whether Allah would forgive or punish the wrongdoers. The decision to forgive or punish rests solely with Allah, as He is the Supreme Judge and the only One with the power to hold people accountable for their actions. The Prophet's role was to convey the message and guide people to the right path, but the ultimate outcome for individuals lies in Allah's hands based on their deeds and intentions.",ليس لك من الأمر شيء أو يتوب عليهم أو يعذبهم فإنهم ظالمون
421,3,129,And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.,"This verse highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty and authority over the entire universe. It emphasizes that forgiveness and punishment are solely determined by Allah's will, as He is the Most Merciful and the source of all mercy and forgiveness. However, His forgiveness is not unconditional; it is granted to those who sincerely repent and mend their ways, while punishment awaits those who persist in disbelief and disobedience. Ultimately, this verse reminds us of our utter dependence on Allah's grace and mercy.",ولله ما في السماوات وما في الأرض يغفر لمن يشاء ويعذب من يشاء والله غفور رحيم
422,3,130,"O you who believe! Do not consume interest, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful.","This verse prohibits dealing with interest or usury (riba) in any form, whether it is a small amount compounded over time or a large sum taken all at once. It commands the believers to have taqwa (consciousness of Allah) and abstain from riba in order to attain true success and prosperity in this life and the Hereafter.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تأكلوا الربا أضعافا مضاعفة واتقوا الله لعلكم تفلحون
423,3,131,"And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers.","This verse warns believers to be mindful of Allah's punishment and to avoid disbelief, which leads to the Hellfire that was created for those who reject faith.

424,3,132,"And obey Allah and the Messenger, so that you may be shown mercy.","This verse emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah and following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.

It also commends those who control their anger and forgive others. Such qualities are pleasing to Allah, who loves those who do good deeds and strive to be righteous.",الذين ينفقون في السراء والضراء والكاظمين الغيظ والعافين عن الناس والله يحب المحسنين
427,3,135,"And those who, when they have committed fahishah (immoral sin) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; - and none can forgive sins but Allah - And do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.","This verse encourages repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah when one commits a sin or wrongdoing. It highlights that only Allah can forgive sins, and emphasizes the importance of not persisting in sinful behavior after recognizing one's mistake. The key to forgiveness is sincere repentance, seeking Allah's pardon, and resolving not to repeat the wrongdoing knowingly.",والذين إذا فعلوا فاحشة أو ظلموا أنفسهم ذكروا الله فاستغفروا لذنوبهم ومن يغفر الذنوب إلا الله ولم يصروا على ما فعلوا وهم يعلمون

The ""gardens beneath which rivers flow"" is a metaphorical description of the blissful Gardens of Paradise, where the believers will live forever in perfect joy and contentment. The phrase ""excellent is the reward of the workers"" emphasizes that those who strive in the path of God will receive an incomparable reward that far exceeds any worldly gains.",أولئك جزاؤهم مغفرة من ربهم وجنات تجري من تحتها الأنهار خالدين فيها ونعم أجر العاملين
429,3,137,"Indeed, there have been examples before you, so travel through the land and observe how was the end of those who denied.","This verse encourages people to reflect on the fate of previous nations who rejected the messengers of God. By traveling and observing the remnants of those civilizations, one can learn valuable lessons about the consequences of denying God's signs and messengers. It serves as a warning against arrogance and disbelief, and highlights the importance of heeding God's guidance to avoid a similar disastrous end.",قد خلت من قبلكم سنن فسيروا في الأرض فانظروا كيف كان عاقبة المكذبين

Such days (of varying fortunes) We give to men and men by turns: that Allah may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to Truth).

Cependant, ces épreuves servent à distinguer les vrais croyants des autres, et ceux qui endurent avec patience et persévérance seront récompensés par Allah. De plus, le verset indique qu'Allah permet ces jours alternés de succès et de revers pour tester la foi des gens, et que ceux qui meurent en martyrs pour la cause d'Allah seront honorés et aimés par Lui.",إن يمسسكم قرح فقد مس القوم قرح مثله وتلك الأيام نداولها بين الناس وليعلم الله الذين آمنوا ويتخذ منكم شهداء والله لا يحب الظالمين
433,3,141,"That Allah may distinguish the believers from the disbelievers,",This verse suggests that one of Allah's purposes is to test and distinguish the true believers from the disbelievers through trials and challenges. This serves to purify the faith of the believers and expose the disbelief of those who reject Allah's guidance. The difficulties faced act as a means of separating the sincere from the insincere.,وليمحص الله الذين آمنوا ويمحق الكافرين
434,3,142,Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast?,This verse emphasizes that entering Paradise requires striving in the cause of Allah and exhibiting patience and steadfastness.

It reminds them that rejecting faith after accepting it will not harm Allah, but He will reward those who remain grateful and steadfast in their belief.",وما محمد إلا رسول قد خلت من قبله الرسل أفإن مات أو قتل انقلبتم على أعقابكم ومن ينقلب على عقبيه فلن يضر الله شيئا وسيجزي الله الشاكرين

And He has already pardoned you, and Allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers.","This verse refers to the Battle of Uhud, where the Muslims initially gained the upper hand but then disobeyed orders, leading to their defeat. Allah reminds them that He had fulfilled His promise of victory initially, but their disobedience and disputes led to their loss. Some were more interested in worldly gains, while others desired the Hereafter. Ultimately, Allah pardoned them and tested their faith, as He is Most Gracious to the believers.",ولقد صدقكم الله وعده إذ تحسونهم بإذنه حتى إذا فشلتم وتنازعتم في الأمر وعصيتم من بعد ما أراكم ما تحبون منكم من يريد الدنيا ومنكم من يريد الآخرة ثم صرفكم عنهم ليبتليكم ولقد عفا عنكم والله ذو فضل على المؤمنين
445,3,153,"When you were going up, paying no attention to anyone, while the Messenger was calling you from your rear, He rewarded you with distress upon distress so that you would not grieve for what had escaped you, nor for what had befallen you. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","This verse refers to the Battle of Hunain, where the Muslims initially fled in panic despite their large numbers, until Allah sent tranquility upon the Prophet and the believers stood firm. It teaches that one should not grieve over missed opportunities or calamities, as Allah is aware of our deeds and will reward or test us accordingly. The ""distress upon distress"" was a lesson to remain steadfast and trust in Allah's plan.",إذ تصعدون ولا تلوون على أحد والرسول يدعوكم في أخراكم فأثابكم غما بغم لكيلا تحزنوا على ما فاتكم ولا ما أصابكم والله خبير بما تعملون

They say, 'If we had anything to do with the matter, we would not have been killed here.' Say, 'Even if you had been inside your homes, those decreed to be killed would have gone forth towards their death beds,' so that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Aware of what is in the hearts.","This verse discusses the state of the believers during the Battle of Uhud. After the initial distress, Allah sent down security and a slumber upon a group of believers. However, another group was preoccupied with their own selfish interests, harboring ignorant thoughts about Allah's decree. They questioned whether they had any say in the matter, to which Allah's response is that all affairs belong to Him alone. They concealed their true thoughts from the Prophet. They claimed that if they had a role, they would not have been killed, but Allah clarifies that those destined to die would have met their fate regardless of their location. This was a test from Allah to purify the hearts of the believers and distinguish their true faith. The interpretation highlights Allah's complete sovereignty, the believers' varying responses during adversity, and the wisdom behind trials as a means of purification.",ثم أنزل عليكم من بعد الغم أمنة نعاسا يغشى طائفة منكم وطائفة قد أهمتهم أنفسهم يظنون بالله غير الحق ظن الجاهلية يقولون هل لنا من الأمر من شيء قل إن الأمر كله لله يخفون في أنفسهم ما لا يبدون لك يقولون لو كان لنا من الأمر شيء ما قتلنا هاهنا قل لو كنتم في بيوتكم لبرز الذين كتب عليهم القتل إلى مضاجعهم وليبتلي الله ما في صدوركم وليمحص ما في قلوبكم والله عليم بذات الصدور

Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.","This verse refers to the Muslims who retreated during the Battle of Uhud. It states that Satan caused them to slip and retreat due to some sins they had committed. However, Allah has pardoned them because He is Forgiving and Forbearing towards His servants' weaknesses.",إن الذين تولوا منكم يوم التقى الجمعان إنما استزلهم الشيطان ببعض ما كسبوا ولقد عفا الله عنهم إن الله غفور حليم

And it is Allah who gives life and causes death, and Allah is Seeing of what you do.","This verse admonishes the believers not to be like the disbelievers who, when their friends or relatives died while traveling or fighting, expressed regret saying that if they had been with them, they would not have died. Allah tells the believers that this is a false notion born out of ignorance, for it is Allah alone who gives life and causes death. He sees all our actions, and we should submit to His decree with patience and faith.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تكونوا كالذين كفروا وقالوا لإخوانهم إذا ضربوا في الأرض أو كانوا غزى لو كانوا عندنا ما ماتوا وما قتلوا ليجعل الله ذلك حسرة في قلوبهم والله يحيي ويميت والله بما تعملون بصير

498,4,6,"And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] their growth. And whoever is self-sufficient should refrain [from consuming the orphan's property]. And whoever is poor - so let him eat within reasonable limits. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.","This verse provides guidance on how to deal with the property of orphans. It instructs to test the orphans' maturity and judgement as they approach marriageable age. If they demonstrate sound reasoning, their property should be handed over to them. However, it warns against consuming their wealth extravagantly or hastily in anticipation of their growth. Those who are financially capable should refrain from using the orphan's wealth, while those in need may consume from it reasonably. When returning the property, witnesses should be present. Ultimately, Allah is the Supreme Reckoner and will hold everyone accountable.",وابتلوا اليتامى حتى إذا بلغوا النكاح فإن آنستم منهم رشدا فادفعوا إليهم أموالهم ولا تأكلوها إسرافا وبدارا أن يكبروا ومن كان غنيا فليستعفف ومن كان فقيرا فليأكل بالمعروف فإذا دفعتم إليهم أموالهم فأشهدوا عليهم وكفى بالله حسيبا

If they do testify, the women should be confined to their homes until they die or Allah provides another solution, which could refer to accepting their repentance or prescribing another punishment.",واللاتي يأتين الفاحشة من نسائكم فاستشهدوا عليهن أربعة منكم فإن شهدوا فأمسكوهن في البيوت حتى يتوفاهن الموت أو يجعل الله لهن سبيلا

Would you take it by way of falsehood and manifest sin?","Allah prohibits taking back the dowry or gifts given to the wife if the husband wishes to divorce her and marry another woman. This would be an injustice and a manifest sin, as the dowry belongs to the wife and cannot be reclaimed merely because the husband wants to end the marriage.",وإن أردتم استبدال زوج مكان زوج وآتيتم إحداهن قنطارا فلا تأخذوا منه شيئا أتأخذونه بهتانا وإثما مبينا

538,4,46,"Among those who are Jewish, there are some who distort the words from their proper places and say, 'We hear and disobey,' and 'Hear without being heard,' and 'Ra'ina,' twisting with their tongues and slandering the religion. Had they said, 'We hear and obey,' and 'Listen,' and 'Unzurna,' it would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe except a little.","This verse criticizes the behavior of some Jews who deliberately distort the meanings of words and commands in their scripture, showing disrespect and disobedience. They use wordplay and twisted phrases to mock the religion instead of sincerely listening and obeying. As a result, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, and only a few among them have true faith.",من الذين هادوا يحرفون الكلم عن مواضعه ويقولون سمعنا وعصينا واسمع غير مسمع وراعنا ليا بألسنتهم وطعنا في الدين ولو أنهم قالوا سمعنا وأطعنا واسمع وانظرنا لكان خيرا لهم وأقوم ولكن لعنهم الله بكفرهم فلا يؤمنون إلا قليلا
539,4,47,"O you who have been given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed, confirming what is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them backwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. And the command of Allah is always executed.","""This verse is a warning and admonition from Allah to the People of the Book, primarily the Jews and Christians, to believe in the Qur'an which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad as it confirms the previous scriptures they possess. If they reject it, Allah threatens to disfigure their faces or turn them away from guidance, or curse them as He cursed those who disobeyed the commandment of the Sabbath. This serves as a reminder that Allah's command is always carried out, and no one can defy His will.""",يا أيها الذين أوتوا الكتاب آمنوا بما نزلنا مصدقا لما معكم من قبل أن نطمس وجوها فنردها على أدبارها أو نلعنهم كما لعنا أصحاب السبت وكان أمر الله مفعولا
540,4,48,"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.","This verse emphasizes the gravity of associating partners with Allah (shirk), which is considered an unforgivable sin. It states that Allah will not pardon those who commit shirk by worshipping or associating others besides Him. However, Allah may forgive lesser sins for whomever He wills. The verse warns that committing shirk is a tremendous sin and a grave falsehood against Allah.",إن الله لا يغفر أن يشرك به ويغفر ما دون ذلك لمن يشاء ومن يشرك بالله فقد افترى إثما عظيما
541,4,49,"Have you not seen those who claim self-purity? Nay, Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged even the smallest speck on a date-stone.","This verse refutes the claim of those who consider themselves pure and righteous based on their own assessment. It emphasizes that true purity comes from Allah alone, Who purifies whomever He wills according to His infinite wisdom and justice. No one has the right to declare themselves pure, as this judgment belongs solely to Allah. The verse also reassures that Allah does not wrong anyone, even to the smallest degree, indicating His perfect fairness and justice.",ألم تر إلى الذين يزكون أنفسهم بل الله يزكي من يشاء ولا يظلمون فتيلا
542,4,50,"See how they fabricate falsehood against Allah, and sufficient is that as a manifest sin.","This verse condemns those who attribute lies to Allah, fabricating religious teachings that have no basis in divine revelation.

The verse warns against such blatant transgression and deception.",انظر كيف يفترون على الله الكذب وكفى به إثما مبينا
543,4,51,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, believing in jibt and taghut and saying to those who disbelieved, ""These are better guided than the believers in the way?""","This verse criticizes those who were given knowledge of the previous scriptures but chose to believe in superstitions and false deities instead of the true faith. It condemns their claim that the disbelievers are better guided than the believers, which is a clear deviation from the truth and a manifestation of their misguided beliefs.",ألم تر إلى الذين أوتوا نصيبا من الكتاب يؤمنون بالجبت والطاغوت ويقولون للذين كفروا هؤلاء أهدى من الذين آمنوا سبيلا
544,4,52,"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed, and whoever Allah curses, you will never find for him a helper.","This verse refers to those who have been cursed by Allah and deprived of His mercy and guidance. It emphasizes that anyone whom Allah curses will have no one to help or support them, as Allah's curse is a severe punishment that leaves the person utterly helpless and without any means of assistance or deliverance.",أولئك الذين لعنهم الله ومن يلعن الله فلن تجد له نصيرا
545,4,53,Or do they have a share in the Dominion? Then they would not give mankind even a speck on a date-stone.,"This verse questions the disbelievers' claim to have a share in God's dominion and authority. It argues that if they truly had any part in the sovereignty, they would not deprive people of even the smallest thing, represented by a ""speck on a date-stone."" This highlights God's absolute control and the falsehood of their claims to any power or authority.",أم لهم نصيب من الملك فإذا لا يؤتون الناس نقيرا
546,4,54,"Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His bounty? But We had already given the family of Abraham the Scripture and wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.","This verse suggests that the disbelievers envy the Muslims because Allah has bestowed upon them His favors and bounties, such as guidance, faith, and knowledge. However, Allah reminds them that He had previously bestowed great favors upon the family of Prophet Abraham, including the Scripture, wisdom, and a great kingdom. The verse implies that just as Allah favored the family of Abraham, He now favors the Muslim community with His bounties, and there is no reason for envy or resentment.",أم يحسدون الناس على ما آتاهم الله من فضله فقد آتينا آل إبراهيم الكتاب والحكمة وآتيناهم ملكا عظيما
547,4,55,"But among them is he who believed in it, and among them is he who turned away from it. And sufficient is Hellfire as a blaze.","This verse refers to the differing responses of people to the Qur'an. Some believed in it and embraced the truth, while others turned away and rejected it.

Every time their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted in Might and Wise.","This verse warns the disbelievers of a severe punishment in the Hellfire. Their skins will be continuously burned and replaced with new skins, allowing them to experience the torment repeatedly. This punishment is a manifestation of Allah's Might and Wisdom, as He is capable of inflicting such a severe punishment on those who reject His signs and guidance.",إن الذين كفروا بآياتنا سوف نصليهم نارا كلما نضجت جلودهم بدلناهم جلودا غيرها ليذوقوا العذاب إن الله كان عزيزا حكيما

Indeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing.","This verse emphasizes the importance of fulfilling trusts and responsibilities, and judging fairly and justly among people. It highlights that being trustworthy, just, and equitable in dealings with others is a command from Allah. The verse also reminds us that Allah is All-Hearing and All-Seeing, aware of our actions and intentions.",إن الله يأمركم أن تؤدوا الأمانات إلى أهلها وإذا حكمتم بين الناس أن تحكموا بالعدل إن الله نعما يعظكم به إن الله كان سميعا بصيرا

And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.","This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah, His Messenger, and those in authority. It also provides guidance on resolving disputes by referring them to Allah and His Messenger, which is the best way to reach a just and correct resolution, especially for those who truly believe in Allah and the Last Day.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول وأولي الأمر منكم فإن تنازعتم في شيء فردوه إلى الله والرسول إن كنتم تؤمنون بالله واليوم الآخر ذلك خير وأحسن تأويلا
552,4,60,"Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you? They wish to refer legislation to Taghut, while they were commanded to reject it; and Satan wishes to lead them far astray.","This verse criticizes the hypocrites who outwardly professed faith in the Qur'an and previous revelations, but inwardly sought judgment from false authorities and idols (Taghut) instead of the divine laws revealed by Allah. It warns that by doing so, they are being misguided by Satan into deviation and misguidance.",ألم تر إلى الذين يزعمون أنهم آمنوا بما أنزل إليك وما أنزل من قبلك يريدون أن يتحاكموا إلى الطاغوت وقد أمروا أن يكفروا به ويريد الشيطان أن يضلهم ضلالا بعيدا

They turn away arrogantly from the truth, refusing to submit to Allah's revelations and the Prophet's authority. It highlights their insincerity and opposition to the Islamic faith.",وإذا قيل لهم تعالوا إلى ما أنزل الله وإلى الرسول رأيت المنافقين يصدون عنك صدودا
554,4,62,"But how [will it be] when a disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth? Then they will come to you swearing by Allah, ""We intended nothing but good conduct and alliances.""","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly profess faith but harbor ill intentions. When faced with consequences of their misdeeds, they will swear by Allah that their intentions were pure and good, seeking only harmony and cooperation. However, Allah knows their true motives which are contrary to their claims.""",فكيف إذا أصابتهم مصيبة بما قدمت أيديهم ثم جاءوك يحلفون بالله إن أردنا إلا إحسانا وتوفيقا
555,4,63,"It is those whose hearts Allah knows what is in them, so turn away from them and admonish them and speak to them a word to reach their very souls.","This verse refers to the hypocrites whose true intentions and lack of faith Allah knows. The Prophet is instructed to turn away from them and not engage with their disbelief, but to admonish and advise them with effective words that may penetrate their souls and guide them to the truth.",أولئك الذين يعلم الله ما في قلوبهم فأعرض عنهم وعظهم وقل لهم في أنفسهم قولا بليغا
556,4,64,"And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by Allah's permission. And if they had, when they wronged themselves, come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Accepting of repentance and Merciful.","Allah sent messengers to be obeyed by His command. If the people who wronged themselves had come to the Prophet, repented, and asked for forgiveness from Allah, and the Prophet had also sought forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Most Forgiving and Merciful.",وما أرسلنا من رسول إلا ليطاع بإذن الله ولو أنهم إذ ظلموا أنفسهم جاءوك فاستغفروا الله واستغفر لهم الرسول لوجدوا الله توابا رحيما

True faith requires complete submission to the Prophet's decisions in all matters of dispute or disagreement among the believers. It highlights the authority given to the Prophet by Allah to settle disputes and the obligation upon the believers to obey his judgments without any internal objection or dissent.,فلا وربك لا يؤمنون حتى يحكموك فيما شجر بينهم ثم لا يجدوا في أنفسهم حرجا مما قضيت ويسلموا تسليما
558,4,66,"And if We had decreed upon them, 'Kill yourselves' or 'Leave your homes,' they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].","This verse highlights the stubbornness and disobedience of some people towards God's commands. Even if God had commanded them to kill themselves or leave their homes, which are extremely difficult acts, most of them would not have obeyed, except for a few. However, if they had followed the guidance and advice given to them, it would have been better for their spiritual well-being and would have strengthened their faith.",ولو أنا كتبنا عليهم أن اقتلوا أنفسكم أو اخرجوا من دياركم ما فعلوه إلا قليل منهم ولو أنهم فعلوا ما يوعظون به لكان خيرا لهم وأشد تثبيتا

The phrase ""from Our presence"" indicates that this reward will come directly from Allah, emphasizing its immense value and honor.",وإذا لآتيناهم من لدنا أجرا عظيما
560,4,68,And We would have guided them to a Straight Path.,"This verse suggests that if people were to follow the guidance of Allah, He would have led them to the straight and righteous path that leads to success in this life and the Hereafter. It implies that Allah provides clear guidance through His revelations and messengers, but it is up to individuals to accept and follow that guidance.",ولهديناهم صراطا مستقيما

563,4,71,"O you who have believed, take your precaution and [either] go forth in companies or go forth all together.","""This verse instructs the believers to be vigilant and take necessary precautions when facing potential danger or conflict.

This guidance promotes safety, preparedness, and unity among the believers in challenging situations.""",يا أيها الذين آمنوا خذوا حذركم فانفروا ثبات أو انفروا جميعا
564,4,72,"And there are certainly among you those who lag behind; then if a misfortune befalls you, he says, 'Indeed, Allah conferred favor upon me when I was not present with them.'","This verse refers to the hypocrites who would make excuses and lag behind when called to fight in the cause of Allah. If the Muslims suffered any harm or loss in battle, these hypocrites would say that it was a blessing from Allah that they were not present, thus escaping the misfortune. Their interpretation reveals their cowardice, lack of faith, and ingratitude towards Allah's favors.",وإن منكم لمن ليبطئن فإن أصابتكم مصيبة قال قد أنعم الله علي إذ لم أكن معهم شهيدا
565,4,73,"And if a bounty comes to you from Allah, he would surely say - as if there had never been any affection between you and him - 'Oh, I wish I had been with them so I could have achieved a great success.'","This verse addresses the hypocrites who outwardly profess faith but inwardly harbor doubts and enmity towards the believers. It warns that if the believers receive any favor or victory from Allah, the hypocrites will express regret and wish they had been with the believers to share in the success, even though they previously showed no sincere affection or loyalty towards the believers. The verse exposes the hypocrites' insincerity and their desire to attain worldly gains without truly believing.",ولئن أصابكم فضل من الله ليقولن كأن لم تكن بينكم وبينه مودة يا ليتني كنت معهم فأفوز فوزا عظيما
566,4,74,"So let those fight in the cause of Allah who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and is killed or achieves victory - We will bestow upon him a great reward.","This verse encourages believers to fight for the cause of Allah, sacrificing the temporary pleasures of this worldly life for the eternal rewards of the Hereafter. It promises a great reward from Allah for those who fight in His cause, whether they are martyred or victorious. The interpretation emphasizes the importance of striving in the path of Allah with sincerity and steadfastness, prioritizing the spiritual over the material.",فليقاتل في سبيل الله الذين يشرون الحياة الدنيا بالآخرة ومن يقاتل في سبيل الله فيقتل أو يغلب فسوف نؤتيه أجرا عظيما

It encourages the believers to help liberate these oppressed people from their difficult situation and establish justice and security for them, as they are calling out to Allah for help and protection.",وما لكم لا تقاتلون في سبيل الله والمستضعفين من الرجال والنساء والولدان الذين يقولون ربنا أخرجنا من هذه القرية الظالم أهلها واجعل لنا من لدنك وليا واجعل لنا من لدنك نصيرا

Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.","This verse highlights the fundamental difference between the believers and the disbelievers in their motives and allegiances. The believers fight in the cause of Allah, which means they strive and sacrifice for the sake of truth, justice, and the establishment of God's divine order on earth. On the other hand, the disbelievers fight in the cause of Taghut, which represents falsehood, oppression, and rebellion against God's authority. The verse commands the believers to fight against the allies of Satan, who are those who follow and support the forces of evil and misguidance. It also reassures the believers that Satan's plots and schemes are ultimately weak and bound to fail, as truth and righteousness will prevail in the end.",الذين آمنوا يقاتلون في سبيل الله والذين كفروا يقاتلون في سبيل الطاغوت فقاتلوا أولياء الشيطان إن كيد الشيطان كان ضعيفا
569,4,77,"Have you not seen those who were told, ""Restrain your hands, establish prayer, and give zakah""? But then when fighting was ordained for them, a group of them feared people as they should have feared Allah, or with greater fear. They said, ""Our Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You had postponed ˹it˺ for us for a little while!"" Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ""The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And you will not be wronged ˹even by˺ a thread on a date stone.""","This verse refers to a group of believers who were initially commanded to restrain themselves from fighting, establish prayer, and give zakah (obligatory charity). However, when they were later ordered to fight, some of them became fearful of the enemy, showing more fear towards people than they should have towards Allah. They questioned why fighting was ordained for them and wished for a delay. The interpretation is that the pleasures of this world are fleeting, and the Hereafter is far better for those who fear Allah and obey His commands. They will not be wronged or deprived of any reward, no matter how small, for their obedience and sacrifices.",ألم تر إلى الذين قيل لهم كفوا أيديكم وأقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة فلما كتب عليهم القتال إذا فريق منهم يخشون الناس كخشية الله أو أشد خشية وقالوا ربنا لم كتبت علينا القتال لولا أخرتنا إلى أجل قريب قل متاع الدنيا قليل والآخرة خير لمن اتقى ولا تظلمون فتيلا

So what is the matter with these people that they can hardly understand any word?","This verse highlights the inevitability of death and the flawed logic of those who attribute good to Allah but evil to others. It teaches that both good and evil are ultimately from Allah's decree, though evil is not from His essence. The inability to comprehend this simple fact shows the people's lack of understanding.",أينما تكونوا يدرككم الموت ولو كنتم في بروج مشيدة وإن تصبهم حسنة يقولوا هذه من عند الله وإن تصبهم سيئة يقولوا هذه من عندك قل كل من عند الله فمال هؤلاء القوم لا يكادون يفقهون حديثا

It also highlights the role of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a Messenger sent by Allah to guide all of humanity.

572,4,80,Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah; but whoever turns away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.,"This verse emphasizes the importance of obeying the Messenger, Prophet Muhammad, as obedience to him is considered obedience to Allah. Those who disobey and turn away from his teachings will not be forced, as the Prophet's role is to convey the message, not to compel belief. The responsibility lies with individuals to make their own choices, and the Prophet is not a ""guardian"" over them to ensure their compliance.",من يطع الرسول فقد أطاع الله ومن تولى فما أرسلناك عليهم حفيظا

The interpretation emphasizes the importance of sincerity in faith and warns against hypocrisy and betrayal.",ويقولون طاعة فإذا برزوا من عندك بيت طائفة منهم غير الذي تقول والله يكتب ما يبيتون فأعرض عنهم وتوكل على الله وكفى بالله وكيلا
574,4,82,"Will they not then ponder over the Quran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much discrepancy.","This verse emphasizes the divine origin and perfection of the Quran. It invites people to reflect deeply upon the Quran. If it had been authored by a human, there would have been many contradictions and discrepancies in it. However, the Quran's consistency, harmony, and lack of contradictions is a clear proof that it is from Allah, the One True God, and not from any human source.",أفلا يتدبرون القرآن ولو كان من عند غير الله لوجدوا فيه اختلافا كثيرا

It encourages the believers to urge and motivate one another to participate in this struggle. The verse suggests that through such efforts, Allah may restrain the might and power of the disbelievers. It also reminds us of Allah's supreme might and His ability to inflict the severest of punishments upon those who reject His message.",فقاتل في سبيل الله لا تكلف إلا نفسك وحرض المؤمنين عسى الله أن يكف بأس الذين كفروا والله أشد بأسا وأشد تنكيلا

And Allah is Ever Watchful over all things.","This verse emphasizes the importance of interceding or advocating for righteous causes, as one will be rewarded for it. However, if one intercedes for an evil or unjust cause, they will bear the consequences of their advocacy.

Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has sent astray? And he whom Allah sends astray - never will you find for him a way.,"This verse criticizes the division among the believers regarding the hypocrites. It states that Allah has led the hypocrites astray due to their evil deeds. The believers should not attempt to guide those whom Allah has allowed to go astray, as it is impossible to find a way to guide someone whom Allah has misguided.",فما لكم في المنافقين فئتين والله أركسهم بما كسبوا أتريدون أن تهدوا من أضل الله ومن يضلل الله فلن تجد له سبيلا

If they do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Against these, We have given you clear authority.","Cette interprétation suggère que certains groupes chercheront à gagner la confiance des musulmans tout en restant liés à leur propre peuple. S'ils ne se retirent pas de la fitna (tentation ou guerre) et ne font pas la paix avec les musulmans, alors les musulmans ont le droit de les combattre et de les tuer où qu'ils les trouvent. Cela donne aux musulmans une autorité claire pour se défendre contre ces groupes hostiles.",ستجدون آخرين يريدون أن يأمنوكم ويأمنوا قومهم كل ما ردوا إلى الفتنة أركسوا فيها فإن لم يعتزلوكم ويلقوا إليكم السلم ويكفوا أيديهم فخذوهم واقتلوهم حيث ثقفتموهم وأولئكم جعلنا لكم عليهم سلطانا مبينا
584,4,92,"And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased's family, unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if the deceased was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave; and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively, [seeking] acceptance of repentance from Allah. And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.","This verse outlines the legal and moral consequences for a believer who unintentionally kills another believer. It emphasizes the sanctity of human life and the gravity of taking a life, even accidentally. The prescribed atonement involves freeing a believing slave, paying compensation to the victim's family (unless they forgo it), and fasting for two consecutive months if unable to fulfill the other obligations. The verse distinguishes between cases where the victim belongs to an enemy group or a group with a treaty, with different rulings applying. Ultimately, it highlights Allah's wisdom in establishing a system of justice and repentance for such grave transgressions.",وما كان لمؤمن أن يقتل مؤمنا إلا خطأ ومن قتل مؤمنا خطأ فتحرير رقبة مؤمنة ودية مسلمة إلى أهله إلا أن يصدقوا فإن كان من قوم عدو لكم وهو مؤمن فتحرير رقبة مؤمنة وإن كان من قوم بينكم وبينهم ميثاق فدية مسلمة إلى أهله وتحرير رقبة مؤمنة فمن لم يجد فصيام شهرين متتابعين توبة من الله وكان الله عليما حكيما
585,4,93,"But whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.","This verse warns against intentionally killing a believer, which is considered a grave sin in Islam. It states that the punishment for such an act is eternal residence in Hell, incurring Allah's anger and curse, and facing a tremendous punishment. This underscores the sanctity of human life and the severity of unlawfully taking it, especially for a believer.",ومن يقتل مؤمنا متعمدا فجزاؤه جهنم خالدا فيها وغضب الله عليه ولعنه وأعد له عذابا عظيما
586,4,94,"O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of Allah, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [greetings of] peace 'You are not a believer,' aspiring for the goods of worldly life; for with Allah are many acquisitions. You [yourselves] were like that before; then Allah conferred His favor upon you, so investigate. Indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.","Allah commands the believers to verify information before taking action, and not to accuse someone who greets them with 'peace' of being a non-believer, out of desire for worldly gains. He reminds them that they were once ignorant before Islam, but Allah guided them, so they should investigate matters thoroughly. Allah is aware of all that they do.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا ضربتم في سبيل الله فتبينوا ولا تقولوا لمن ألقى إليكم السلام لست مؤمنا تبتغون عرض الحياة الدنيا فعند الله مغانم كثيرة كذلك كنتم من قبل فمن الله عليكم فتبينوا إن الله كان بما تعملون خبيرا
587,4,95,"Not equal are those believers remaining [at home] - other than the disabled - and the mujahideen, [who strive and fight] in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred the mujahideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain, by degrees. And to both Allah has promised the best [reward]. But Allah has preferred the mujahideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward.","This verse highlights the superiority of those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah over those who stay behind, except for those with valid excuses like disability. The mujahideen who sacrifice their wealth and lives for Allah's cause are given a higher rank and a greater reward by Allah than those who remain passive. However, both groups are promised the best reward from Allah, but the mujahideen are preferred and given a greater reward for their sacrifices and struggles.",لا يستوي القاعدون من المؤمنين غير أولي الضرر والمجاهدون في سبيل الله بأموالهم وأنفسهم فضل الله المجاهدين بأموالهم وأنفسهم على القاعدين درجة وكلا وعد الله الحسنى وفضل الله المجاهدين على القاعدين أجرا عظيما
588,4,96,"Degrees [of high position] from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.","This verse highlights the immense rewards and blessings that Allah has prepared for the believers. It speaks of ""degrees"" or elevated ranks in Paradise, which will be bestowed upon them according to their faith and good deeds. Additionally, they will receive forgiveness for their sins and shortcomings, as well as Allah's infinite mercy. The verse concludes by emphasizing that Allah is the Most Forgiving and Most Merciful, reminding us of His boundless grace and compassion towards those who strive to follow His path.",درجات منه ومغفرة ورحمة وكان الله غفورا رحيما
589,4,97,"Indeed, those whose souls the angels took while they were wronging themselves, they said, 'In what condition were you?' They said, 'We were oppressed in the land.' They said, 'Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?' Those - their refuge is Hell, and evil it is as a destination.","This verse refers to those who did not migrate from the lands of oppression and disbelief, despite having the ability to do so. They made excuses for staying, claiming they were oppressed, but Allah reminds them that His earth is vast, and they could have emigrated to lands where they could practice their faith freely. Their punishment for failing to migrate and remaining in disbelief is that their abode will be Hell, which is a terrible destination.",إن الذين توفاهم الملائكة ظالمي أنفسهم قالوا فيم كنتم قالوا كنا مستضعفين في الأرض قالوا ألم تكن أرض الله واسعة فتهاجروا فيها فأولئك مأواهم جهنم وساءت مصيرا
590,4,98,"Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way.","This verse refers to those who are helpless and unable to migrate or find a way out of oppression, such as the weak, elderly, women, and children. They are excused from the obligation to migrate from lands of oppression, as they lack the means or ability to do so. Allah acknowledges their difficult circumstances and exempts them from this duty.",إلا المستضعفين من الرجال والنساء والولدان لا يستطيعون حيلة ولا يهتدون سبيلا
591,4,99,"For those - Allah may pardon them, and Allah is ever Pardoning and Forgiving.","This verse implies that there is hope for forgiveness from Allah for those who repent and turn back to Him. It highlights Allah's attribute of being the Pardoner (al-'Afuww) and the Oft-Forgiving (al-Ghafoor), suggesting that He may overlook the sins of those who seek His forgiveness sincerely.",فأولئك عسى الله أن يعفو عنهم وكان الله عفوا غفورا
592,4,100,And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance. And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward has already fallen upon Allah. And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.,"This verse encourages migration or emigration for the sake of Allah. It promises that those who migrate for Allah's cause will find many places of refuge and provisions in the land. Additionally, if someone leaves their home intending to migrate for Allah and His Messenger but dies before reaching the destination, Allah will still reward them fully. This highlights Allah's forgiveness and mercy towards those who strive in His path.",ومن يهاجر في سبيل الله يجد في الأرض مراغما كثيرا وسعة ومن يخرج من بيته مهاجرا إلى الله ورسوله ثم يدركه الموت فقد وقع أجره على الله وكان الله غفورا رحيما
593,4,101,"And when you travel in the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you. Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.","This verse allows Muslims to shorten their prayers during travel, if they fear being attacked or disrupted by disbelievers. It acknowledges the reality of potential hostility and danger from those who reject Islam, and grants a concession to abbreviate the obligatory prayers in such circumstances. The wisdom behind this allowance is to facilitate the worship of believers while ensuring their safety and security when traveling through regions where they may face threats from hostile disbelievers.",وإذا ضربتم في الأرض فليس عليكم جناح أن تقصروا من الصلاة إن خفتم أن يفتنكم الذين كفروا إن الكافرين كانوا لكم عدوا مبينا
594,4,102,"And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them take position behind you, and let another group who have not yet prayed come forward and pray with you, being cautious and carrying their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your arms and your baggage so they could attack you in a single charge. But there is no blame upon you for putting your arms down due to trouble from rain or because you are ill. But take your precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.","This verse provides instructions for offering prayers in a state of war and potential danger from the enemy. It allows for dividing the believers into two groups, where one group guards with their weapons while the other prays, then they switch roles. This way, they can fulfill their religious obligation while remaining vigilant against enemy attacks. It also reassures them that if they must put down their arms due to rain or illness, they are not blameworthy, but they should still take precautions. The verse concludes with a warning to the disbelievers of a humiliating punishment from Allah.",وإذا كنت فيهم فأقمت لهم الصلاة فلتقم طائفة منهم معك وليأخذوا أسلحتهم فإذا سجدوا فليكونوا من ورائكم ولتأت طائفة أخرى لم يصلوا فليصلوا معك وليأخذوا حذرهم وأسلحتهم ود الذين كفروا لو تغفلون عن أسلحتكم وأمتعتكم فيميلون عليكم ميلة واحدة ولا جناح عليكم إن كان بكم أذى من مطر أو كنتم مرضى أن تضعوا أسلحتكم وخذوا حذركم إن الله أعد للكافرين عذابا مهينا
595,4,103,"So when you have completed the prayer, then remember Allah standing, sitting, and [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.","This verse emphasizes the importance of remembering Allah at all times and in all circumstances, whether standing, sitting, or lying down. It also instructs believers to perform the obligatory prayers at their appointed times once they are in a state of security and safety. The verse highlights that prayer is a divinely ordained obligation upon believers, with specific timings prescribed for its performance.",فإذا قضيتم الصلاة فاذكروا الله قياما وقعودا وعلى جنوبكم فإذا اطمأننتم فأقيموا الصلاة إن الصلاة كانت على المؤمنين كتابا موقوتا
596,4,104,"And do not falter or grieve, for you will gain mastery if you are true believers. If you have suffered a misfortune, remember that the enemy has also suffered a similar misfortune. We alternate these vicissitudes among people so that God may know the true believers and choose witnesses from among you; and God does not love the unjust.","This verse encourages the believers to remain steadfast and not lose hope in the face of adversity or suffering. It reminds them that the disbelievers also experience hardship, and that God alternates between giving victory and defeat to different groups as a test of faith. The true believers are those who remain patient and trust in God's wisdom and justice, even in difficult times. The verse also emphasizes that God does not love those who are unjust or oppressive.",ولا تهنوا في ابتغاء القوم إن تكونوا تألمون فإنهم يألمون كما تألمون وترجون من الله ما لا يرجون وكان الله عليما حكيما
597,4,105,"Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book in truth that you may judge between people by that which Allah has shown you. And do not be for the deceitful an advocate.",This verse emphasizes the divine revelation of the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad as a source of truth and guidance. It instructs him to judge between people fairly based on what Allah has taught him through this revelation. The verse also warns him against siding with or defending those who are deceitful or treacherous.,إنا أنزلنا إليك الكتاب بالحق لتحكم بين الناس بما أراك الله ولا تكن للخائنين خصيما

599,4,107,"And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Indeed, Allah does not like anyone who is a habitual betrayer and sinner.",This verse advises against defending or making excuses for those who consciously deceive themselves by rejecting faith and truth. Allah does not love those who habitually betray their covenant with Him and persist in sinful ways.,ولا تجادل عن الذين يختانون أنفسهم إن الله لا يحب من كان خوانا أثيما
600,4,108,"They hide from the people but cannot hide from Allah, while He is with them when they plot by night in words that do not please Him. And ever is Allah, of what they do, encompassing.","The interpretation is that the hypocrites try to conceal their disbelief and evil intentions from people, but they cannot hide anything from Allah. He is fully aware of their secret plots and conspiracies against the believers, which they devise at night in words that are displeasing to Allah. Allah encompasses and has complete knowledge of all their actions and evil deeds.",يستخفون من الناس ولا يستخفون من الله وهو معهم إذ يبيتون ما لا يرضى من القول وكان الله بما يعملون محيطا

But who will argue with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be a representative for them?","This verse highlights the futility of defending or advocating for false beliefs and ideologies in this worldly life. On the Day of Resurrection, none will be able to argue with Allah or represent those who persisted in falsehood. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and adhering to the truth in this life, as no one will be able to intercede or defend those who rejected the truth on that final Day.",ها أنتم هؤلاء جادلتم عنهم في الحياة الدنيا فمن يجادل الله عنهم يوم القيامة أم من يكون عليهم وكيلا
602,4,110,"And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness from Allah, he will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful.","This verse emphasizes the vastness of Allah's mercy and forgiveness. It encourages those who have committed sins or wronged themselves to repent sincerely and seek Allah's forgiveness, as He is ever willing to pardon and have mercy on those who turn to Him in repentance. It highlights Allah's infinite grace and reminds us that no sin is unforgivable as long as one genuinely repents and resolves to mend one's ways.",ومن يعمل سوءا أو يظلم نفسه ثم يستغفر الله يجد الله غفورا رحيما
603,4,111,"And whoever commits a sin, commits it only against himself. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.","This verse emphasizes the principle of individual accountability in Islam. Each person is responsible for their own actions and will bear the consequences of their sins. The phrase ""commits it only against himself"" highlights that the harm caused by one's sins ultimately falls upon oneself, even if others are affected. At the same time, Allah is All-Knowing, aware of everyone's deeds, and All-Wise, ensuring that justice is served accordingly.",ومن يكسب إثما فإنما يكسبه على نفسه وكان الله عليما حكيما
604,4,112,"And whoever commits a sin or an offense, then blames an innocent person for it, has certainly burdened himself with slander and a manifest sin.","This verse warns against falsely accusing innocent people of sins or crimes they did not commit. It emphasizes that such an act is a grave sin in itself, as it burdens the accuser with slander and a blatant wrong.

And Allah's favor upon you has been tremendous.","This verse highlights the immense favor and mercy of Allah upon the Prophet Muhammad. It states that had it not been for Allah's grace and mercy, some people would have misled the Prophet, but they could not harm him in any way because Allah protected him. The verse also mentions that Allah revealed the Quran and wisdom to the Prophet and taught him what he did not know, which was a tremendous blessing upon him.",ولولا فضل الله عليك ورحمته لهمت طائفة منهم أن يضلوك وما يضلون إلا أنفسهم وما يضرونك من شيء وأنزل الله عليك الكتاب والحكمة وعلمك ما لم تكن تعلم وكان فضل الله عليك عظيما

And whoever does that seeking the pleasure of Allah - We are going to give him a great reward.","This verse discourages engaging in idle talk and secret conversations that do not benefit anyone. However, it makes an exception for those conversations that encourage acts of charity, righteousness, or reconciliation between people.

And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.","This verse emphasizes the grave sin of associating partners with Allah (shirk) and states that Allah will never forgive it. However, Allah may forgive other sins, lesser than shirk, for whomever He wills. The verse warns that those who commit shirk have strayed far from the right path and fallen into profound misguidance.",إن الله لا يغفر أن يشرك به ويغفر ما دون ذلك لمن يشاء ومن يشرك بالله فقد ضل ضلالا بعيدا
609,4,117,"They call upon none but females, and they call upon none but a rebellious Satan.","This verse criticizes the pagan Arabs who worshipped female deities and idols, which were mere figments of their imagination and had no power or authority. Their worship of these false gods was akin to worshipping Satan, who had led them astray and turned them away from the true worship of the One God.",إن يدعون من دونه إلا إناثا وإن يدعون إلا شيطانا مريدا
610,4,118,"Allah cursed him and he said, 'I will surely take a predestined share of Your servants.'","This verse refers to Satan's arrogance and rebellion against Allah. After being commanded to prostrate to Adam, Satan refused out of pride and arrogance. As a result, Allah cursed him. Satan then vowed to mislead and misguide a portion of Allah's servants, taking advantage of their weaknesses and desires to lead them astray from the straight path. This highlights Satan's enmity towards humanity and his role as the source of evil whisperings and temptations.",لعنه الله وقال لأتخذن من عبادك نصيبا مفروضا
611,4,119,"And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah.

He makes false promises and entices people with vain desires and temptations, but in reality, he only aims to lead them astray and make them fall into misguidance. His promises are nothing but delusions and falsehoods designed to misguide people from the straight path.",يعدهم ويمنيهم وما يعدهم الشيطان إلا غرورا
613,4,121,"Those - their refuge is Hell, and they will not find from it any escape.","This verse warns that those who reject faith and follow disbelief and evil will have Hell as their final abode, from which they will find no way to escape or be saved.

And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of it.",This verse addresses the issue of orphan women and their rights in marriage and inheritance. It instructs the believers to give orphan women their due share of inheritance and not to marry them solely for the purpose of acquiring their wealth. The verse also emphasizes the importance of upholding justice for orphans and protecting the rights of vulnerable children.

But if you do good and fear Allah, then indeed Allah is ever Acquainted with what you do.","If a wife fears mistreatment or neglect from her husband, it is permissible for them to mutually agree on terms to resolve their marital issues through negotiation and compromise. Reconciliation and settlement are better than divorce. However, human souls are prone to greed and selfishness. If both spouses act righteously, make compromises, and remain conscious of Allah, then Allah is fully aware of their actions and intentions.",وإن امرأة خافت من بعلها نشوزا أو إعراضا فلا جناح عليهما أن يصلحا بينهما صلحا والصلح خير وأحضرت الأنفس الشح وإن تحسنوا وتتقوا فإن الله كان بما تعملون خبيرا

627,4,135,"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do.","This verse commands the believers to uphold justice at all times, even if it goes against their own interests or the interests of their loved ones. It instructs them to be impartial witnesses for the sake of Allah, regardless of the wealth or poverty of those involved. The verse warns against letting hatred or bias towards any group lead to injustice, as being just is closer to righteousness. It reminds the believers that Allah is aware of all their actions, so they should fear Him and act with justice and fairness.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا كونوا قوامين بالقسط شهداء لله ولو على أنفسكم أو الوالدين والأقربين إن يكن غنيا أو فقيرا فالله أولى بهما فلا تتبعوا الهوى أن تعدلوا وإن تلووا أو تعرضوا فإن الله كان بما تعملون خبيرا
628,4,136,"O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray.","This verse commands the believers to have faith in Allah, His Messenger Muhammad, the Quran revealed to him, and the previous Scriptures like the Torah and the Gospel. It warns against disbelief in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection, as that leads to going far astray from the right path.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا آمنوا بالله ورسوله والكتاب الذي نزل على رسوله والكتاب الذي أنزل من قبل ومن يكفر بالله وملائكته وكتبه ورسله واليوم الآخر فقد ضل ضلالا بعيدا
629,4,137,"Indeed, those who have believed then disbelieved, then believed, then disbelieved, and increased in disbelief - never will Allah forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way.",This verse refers to those who repeatedly rejected faith after initially believing. Their persistent rejection of faith and increase in disbelief has made them ineligible for Allah's forgiveness and guidance. It highlights the grave consequences of willfully turning away from faith despite being exposed to the truth.,إن الذين آمنوا ثم كفروا ثم آمنوا ثم كفروا ثم ازدادوا كفرا لم يكن الله ليغفر لهم ولا ليهديهم سبيلا
630,4,138,Give tidings to the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment.,"This verse warns the hypocrites, those who outwardly profess faith but inwardly conceal disbelief and hypocrisy, that they will face a severe and agonizing punishment from Allah for their deceitful ways. It serves as a stern warning against insincerity in faith and encourages true belief and righteous conduct.",بشر المنافقين بأن لهم عذابا أليما
631,4,139,"Those who take disbelievers as allies instead of believers, do they seek with them honor [and power]? But indeed, honor belongs to Allah entirely.","This verse warns against taking disbelievers as allies or close associates instead of believers. It emphasizes that true honor and power belong solely to Allah, not to the disbelievers. Seeking honor or might through allying with disbelievers is misguided, as all honor and glory ultimately come from Allah alone.",الذين يتخذون الكافرين أولياء من دون المؤمنين أيبتغون عندهم العزة فإن العزة لله جميعا
632,4,140,"And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together.","This verse commands the believers not to remain in gatherings where the verses of the Qur'an are mocked or denied. It instructs them to leave such company until the subject is changed, lest they become like the mockers themselves. The verse warns that Allah will ultimately gather the hypocrites and disbelievers together in Hell as a punishment for their rejection of faith.",وقد نزل عليكم في الكتاب أن إذا سمعتم آيات الله يكفر بها ويستهزأ بها فلا تقعدوا معهم حتى يخوضوا في حديث غيره إنكم إذا مثلهم إن الله جامع المنافقين والكافرين في جهنم جميعا

But if the disbelievers get a share, they say, 'Did we not gain mastery over you, and protect you from the believers?' Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will never allow the disbelievers a way over the believers.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who pretended to be Muslims but secretly wished for the defeat of the believers. If the Muslims were victorious, the hypocrites would claim to be on their side. But if the disbelievers had a share of victory, the hypocrites would claim that they had overpowered the believers and protected themselves from them. The verse warns that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will expose the true intentions of the hypocrites and will never allow the disbelievers to overpower the believers.",الذين يتربصون بكم فإن كان لكم فتح من الله قالوا ألم نكن معكم وإن كان للكافرين نصيب قالوا ألم نستحوذ عليكم ونمنعكم من المؤمنين فالله يحكم بينكم يوم القيامة ولن يجعل الله للكافرين على المؤمنين سبيلا
634,4,142,"Indeed, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He is the One who deceives them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing off to the people and not remembering Allah except a little.","This verse exposes the true nature of the hypocrites, who outwardly claim to be believers but inwardly harbor disbelief and deception. They think they can deceive Allah, but in reality, it is Allah who allows them to be deceived by their own arrogance and insincerity. Their prayer is devoid of humility and sincerity, as they perform it lazily and only to be seen by others, without truly remembering Allah and His greatness.",إن المنافقين يخادعون الله وهو خادعهم وإذا قاموا إلى الصلاة قاموا كسالى يراءون الناس ولا يذكرون الله إلا قليلا
635,4,143,"Wavering between that, not towards these, nor towards those. And whomever Allah leaves astray, you will never find for him a way.","This verse describes the state of those who are indecisive and wavering in their faith, neither fully embracing the truth nor rejecting it. They are likened to being lost, unable to find the right path. The interpretation emphasizes that those whom Allah allows to go astray will find it impossible to find guidance, as they have rejected the means to attain it.",مذبذبين بين ذلك لا إلى هؤلاء ولا إلى هؤلاء ومن يضلل الله فلن تجد له سبيلا
636,4,144,"O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to give Allah against yourselves a clear case?","This verse forbids the believers from taking disbelievers as close friends or allies instead of believers. It warns that doing so would provide a clear proof against the believers themselves on the Day of Judgment, as they would have preferred the company of disbelievers over the believers.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تتخذوا الكافرين أولياء من دون المؤمنين أتريدون أن تجعلوا لله عليكم سلطانا مبينا
637,4,145,"Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire - and never will you find for them a helper.","This verse warns that the hypocrites, those who outwardly professed faith but inwardly concealed disbelief and ill intentions, will be condemned to the lowest and most severe level of Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.

Those who fulfill these conditions will be counted among the believers and will receive a great reward from Allah. It emphasizes that true faith requires not only belief but also righteous actions and a genuine commitment to living according to Allah's teachings.",إلا الذين تابوا وأصلحوا واعتصموا بالله وأخلصوا دينهم لله فأولئك مع المؤمنين وسوف يؤت الله المؤمنين أجرا عظيما
639,4,147,"What would Allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe? And Allah is Ever All-Appreciative, All-Knowing.","This verse highlights the mercy of Allah and His appreciation for those who are grateful and have faith. It suggests that if people embrace gratitude and belief, Allah will not punish them, as He is Appreciative of their efforts and Knowing of their sincere intentions.",ما يفعل الله بعذابكم إن شكرتم وآمنتم وكان الله شاكرا عليما
640,4,148,Allah does not like the public mention of evil words except by one who has been wronged. And ever is Allah Hearing and Knowing.,"This verse indicates that Allah dislikes public utterance of offensive or obscene words, except in cases where one has been wronged or oppressed. In such cases, the wronged person is permitted to speak out against the injustice they have faced. However, even then, moderation and wisdom should be observed. The verse also reminds us that Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing, so He is aware of all words spoken, whether good or bad.",لا يحب الله الجهر بالسوء من القول إلا من ظلم وكان الله سميعا عليما
641,4,149,"If you disclose acts of charity, even so it is well, but if you conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And Allah is well-acquainted with what you do.","This verse encourages both disclosing and concealing good deeds. Disclosing them publicly is acceptable, but concealing them and giving charity secretly to the needy is better and more virtuous, as it purifies one's soul from sins and misdeeds. Ultimately, Allah is aware of all our actions, whether done publicly or privately.",إن تبدوا خيرا أو تخفوه أو تعفوا عن سوء فإن الله كان عفوا قديرا
642,4,150,"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allah and His messengers and say, 'We believe in some and disbelieve in others,' and wish to adopt a way in between -","This verse condemns the attitude of those who reject the unity of faith in Allah and His messengers. It criticizes those who claim to believe in some messengers while disbelieving in others, attempting to create divisions and distinctions where none should exist. The verse emphasizes the necessity of accepting all of Allah's messengers and revelations without discrimination or picking and choosing. It rejects the notion of adopting a middle path or compromising stance between belief and disbelief.",إن الذين يكفرون بالله ورسله ويريدون أن يفرقوا بين الله ورسله ويقولون نؤمن ببعض ونكفر ببعض ويريدون أن يتخذوا بين ذلك سبيلا
643,4,151,"Those are the true disbelievers, and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.","This verse emphasizes the reality that those who reject faith in God and His revelations are truly disbelievers. It also serves as a stern warning that God has prepared a humiliating and painful punishment for such disbelievers in the Hereafter. The verse underscores the gravity of disbelief and its consequences, motivating people to embrace faith and avoid the terrible fate awaiting those who stubbornly reject the truth.",أولئك هم الكافرون حقا وأعتدنا للكافرين عذابا مهينا

645,4,153,"The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a book from the heavens. They had already asked Moses for something even greater than that, saying, 'Show us Allah outright,' and they were struck by a thunderbolt for their wickedness. Then they took up the Calf for worship after the clear proofs had come to them. Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses clear authority.","This verse is criticizing the stubbornness and arrogance of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). They demanded miracles from the Prophet Muhammad, just as their ancestors had demanded miracles from Prophet Moses. Their ancestors went so far as to demand to see God directly, which was an impossible and arrogant request. As a result, they were punished by a thunderbolt for their wickedness. Even after witnessing clear miracles from Moses, they still worshipped the Calf idol. Despite their disobedience, God pardoned them and gave Moses clear authority and miracles. This verse serves as a warning against making unreasonable demands from the prophets and a reminder of God's mercy and forgiveness.",يسألك أهل الكتاب أن تنزل عليهم كتابا من السماء فقد سألوا موسى أكبر من ذلك فقالوا أرنا الله جهرة فأخذتهم الصاعقة بظلمهم ثم اتخذوا العجل من بعد ما جاءتهم البينات فعفونا عن ذلك وآتينا موسى سلطانا مبينا
646,4,154,"And We raised over them the mount for [refusal of] their covenant; and We said to them, 'Enter the gate bowing humbly', and We said to them, 'Do not transgress on the sabbath' - and We took from them a solemn covenant.","Allah reminds the Children of Israel of the favors He bestowed upon them when He raised Mount Sinai over them as a threat to compel them to accept the covenant. He commanded them to enter the holy land in humility and not to violate the sanctity of the Sabbath, but they broke their covenant. This verse serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of fulfilling one's covenants with Allah.",ورفعنا فوقهم الطور بميثاقهم وقلنا لهم ادخلوا الباب سجدا وقلنا لهم لا تعدوا في السبت وأخذنا منهم ميثاقا غليظا

It is due to their violation of the covenant made with Allah, their rejection of His revelations and signs, their unjust killing of prophets, and their arrogant claim that their hearts are sealed and unable to comprehend the truth. As a result of their persistent disbelief, Allah has sealed their hearts, leaving only a few among them to have faith.",فبما نقضهم ميثاقهم وكفرهم بآيات الله وقتلهم الأنبياء بغير حق وقولهم قلوبنا غلف بل طبع الله عليها بكفرهم فلا يؤمنون إلا قليلا
648,4,156,And for their disbelief and their uttering against Mary a grave false charge,"This verse refers to the disbelief of the Jews and their slanderous accusation against the chaste and virtuous Mary, the mother of Jesus. By accusing her of an immoral act, they committed a grave sin and uttered an egregious lie against her.",وبكفرهم وقولهم على مريم بهتانا عظيما
649,4,157,"And their saying, ""We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah."" But they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; rather, it was made to appear so to them. Those who differed about it are in doubt concerning it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. Certainly, they did not kill him.","This verse refutes the claim of the Jews that they killed Jesus, the Messiah and messenger of Allah. It clearly states that they neither killed nor crucified him, but it was merely made to appear so to them. Those who differed and argued about this matter were in doubt and had no certain knowledge, only following assumptions and conjectures. The verse emphasizes that they certainly did not kill Jesus.",وقولهم إنا قتلنا المسيح عيسى ابن مريم رسول الله وما قتلوه وما صلبوه ولكن شبه لهم وإن الذين اختلفوا فيه لفي شك منه ما لهم به من علم إلا اتباع الظن وما قتلوه يقينا
650,4,158,"Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.","This verse refers to the event of Jesus' ascension to Allah. It affirms that Allah raised Jesus up to Himself, rather than him being killed or crucified as claimed by some. This demonstrates Allah's Power and Wisdom in preserving Jesus and exalting him.

On the Day of Judgment, the Prophet Muhammad will testify against those who rejected his message despite knowing the truth.",وإن من أهل الكتاب إلا ليؤمنن به قبل موته ويوم القيامة يكون عليهم شهيدا
652,4,160,"For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful to them, and for their averting from the way of Allah many [people].","This verse indicates that as a punishment for the disobedience and wrongdoing of the Jews, Allah prohibited for them certain pure and lawful foods that were previously permissible. This was a consequence of their rejection of Allah's commandments and their attempts to lead others astray from Allah's path.",فبظلم من الذين هادوا حرمنا عليهم طيبات أحلت لهم وبصدهم عن سبيل الله كثيرا

And Allah spoke to Moses directly.,"This verse indicates that while Allah has revealed the stories of some messengers in the Qur'an, there were other messengers whose stories were not mentioned. It also affirms that Allah spoke directly to Prophet Moses, which is a great honor bestowed upon him.",ورسلا قد قصصناهم عليك من قبل ورسلا لم نقصصهم عليك وكلم الله موسى تكليما
657,4,165,Messengers as bearers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no plea against Allah after the messengers. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.,"This verse highlights the purpose of sending Messengers, which is to convey the divine message and guidance to humanity, acting as bearers of good news for those who believe and follow the truth, and warners against the consequences of disbelief and disobedience.

It declares carrion, blood, pork, animals sacrificed to other than Allah, strangled animals, beaten to death animals, animals killed by falling, gored to death animals, and animals partially eaten by wild beasts as unlawful to consume, except for the animals that are properly slaughtered according to Islamic rites. It also prohibits divination by arrows, which was a pagan Arab practice. The verse then declares that the disbelievers have lost hope of overpowering Islam, so Muslims should not fear them but fear Allah alone. It affirms that Allah has perfected the religion of Islam and completed His favor upon the believers by choosing Islam as their way of life. However, if one is compelled by extreme hunger and has no intention of wrongdoing, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards such a person.",حرمت عليكم الميتة والدم ولحم الخنزير وما أهل لغير الله به والمنخنقة والموقوذة والمتردية والنطيحة وما أكل السبع إلا ما ذكيتم وما ذبح على النصب وأن تستقسموا بالأزلام ذلكم فسق اليوم يئس الذين كفروا من دينكم فلا تخشوهم واخشون اليوم أكملت لكم دينكم وأتممت عليكم نعمتي ورضيت لكم الإسلام دينا فمن اضطر في مخمصة غير متجانف لإثم فإن الله غفور رحيم

In this land are a people of arrogant power, and we shall never enter it until they leave it; if they leave it, then we will enter it.'","This verse refers to the hesitation and lack of faith shown by the Israelites when Moses commanded them to enter the Promised Land.

711,5,43,"And how is it that they ask you to judge between them, when they have the Torah, in which is the judgment of Allah? Yet even after that they turn away. Those are not believers.","This verse questions the sincerity of those who claim to believe in the Torah, yet refuse to abide by its teachings and Allah's commandments contained within it. It implies that true faith requires adherence to divine revelations, and those who reject or turn away from them cannot be considered true believers.",وكيف يحكمونك وعندهم التوراة فيها حكم الله ثم يتولون من بعد ذلك وما أولئك بالمؤمنين
712,5,44,"Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.","Allah révèle dans ce verset qu'Il a fait descendre la Torah (Ancien Testament) contenant des directives et de la lumière. Les prophètes soumis à Allah, ainsi que les rabbins et les savants juifs, jugeaient selon la Torah qui leur avait été confiée par Allah, et ils en étaient les témoins. Le verset exhorte alors à ne pas craindre les gens mais à craindre Allah, et à ne pas échanger les versets d'Allah contre une mince récompense. Ceux qui ne jugent pas selon ce qu'Allah a révélé sont qualifiés de mécréants.",إنا أنزلنا التوراة فيها هدى ونور يحكم بها النبيون الذين أسلموا للذين هادوا والربانيون والأحبار بما استحفظوا من كتاب الله وكانوا عليه شهداء فلا تخشوا الناس واخشون ولا تشتروا بآياتي ثمنا قليلا ومن لم يحكم بما أنزل الله فأولئك هم الكافرون
713,5,45,"And We ordained for them therein a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is legal retribution. But whoever remits it by way of charity, it is an expiation for him. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.","This verse outlines the principle of ""qisas"" or equal retaliation in cases of intentional physical harm. It prescribes that a life should be taken for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, and so on. However, it also allows for forgiveness and accepting compensation as an ""expiation"" or atonement. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has revealed are considered wrongdoers. The verse promotes justice and deterrence, while also encouraging forgiveness and reconciliation.",وكتبنا عليهم فيها أن النفس بالنفس والعين بالعين والأنف بالأنف والأذن بالأذن والسن بالسن والجروح قصاص فمن تصدق به فهو كفارة له ومن لم يحكم بما أنزل الله فأولئك هم الظالمون

And We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirmation of the Torah that had come before it, a guidance and an admonition for the God-fearing.","This verse indicates that God sent Jesus, the son of Mary, to confirm the truth of the Torah that was revealed before him. God also gave him the Gospel, which contained guidance, light, and confirmation of the Torah.

And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.,"""This verse emphasizes the importance of adhering to the divine revelations and laws sent by Allah. It commands the Christians (People of the Gospel) to judge and rule according to the teachings revealed in their scripture, the Gospel. Those who reject or defy the judgments prescribed by Allah are considered disobedient transgressors (faasiqoon).""",وليحكم أهل الإنجيل بما أنزل الله فيه ومن لم يحكم بما أنزل الله فأولئك هم الفاسقون
716,5,48,"And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and a watcher over it; so judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you.",هذه الآية تشير إلى أن القرآن الكريم هو كتاب حق أنزله الله تعالى على نبيه محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، مصدقًا للكتب السماوية السابقة ومهيمنًا عليها. فالقرآن هو المرجع الأسمى والحكم النهائي، وعلى المسلمين أن يحكموا بما أنزل الله ولا يتبعوا أهواءهم الشخصية. كما أن الله جعل لكل أمة شريعة ومنهاجًا، ولو شاء لجعل الناس أمة واحدة، ولكنه ابتلاهم باختلاف الشرائع ليبلوهم فيما آتاهم من هدى وضلال. وفي النهاية، سيرجع الجميع إلى الله فيحكم بينهم فيما كانوا فيه يختلفون.,وأنزلنا إليك الكتاب بالحق مصدقا لما بين يديه من الكتاب ومهيمنا عليه فاحكم بينهم بما أنزل الله ولا تتبع أهواءهم عما جاءك من الحق لكل جعلنا منكم شرعة ومنهاجا ولو شاء الله لجعلكم أمة واحدة ولكن ليبلوكم في ما آتاكم فاستبقوا الخيرات إلى الله مرجعكم جميعا فينبئكم بما كنتم فيه تختلفون

But if they turn away, then know that Allah only intends to afflict them with some of their sins.

It warns him to be cautious lest they mislead him from some of what Allah has revealed. If they turn away and refuse to accept the judgment, then they will be afflicted with the consequences of their sins. Many people are defiantly disobedient to Allah's commands.",وأن احكم بينهم بما أنزل الله ولا تتبع أهواءهم واحذرهم أن يفتنوك عن بعض ما أنزل الله إليك فإن تولوا فاعلم أنما يريد الله أن يصيبهم ببعض ذنوبهم وإن كثيرا من الناس لفاسقون

But who is better than Allah in judgement for a people who are certain [in faith]?,This verse questions those who reject the laws and judgments revealed by Allah in the Qur'an and instead desire to follow the ignorant judgments of the pre-Islamic era. It affirms that Allah's laws and judgments are the most perfect and just for those who have firm faith and certainty in Him.,أفحكم الجاهلية يبغون ومن أحسن من الله حكما لقوم يوقنون
719,5,51,"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.","Allah commands the believers not to take the Jews and Christians as close allies or protectors, because they are allies of one another against the Muslims. If a Muslim allies with them, he is considered one of them. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people who ally with the disbelievers against the believers.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تتخذوا اليهود والنصارى أولياء بعضهم أولياء بعض ومن يتولهم منكم فإنه منهم إن الله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين

But perhaps Allah will bring conquest or a command from Himself, and they will become, over what they have concealed within themselves, regretful.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly claimed to be Muslims but inwardly harbored doubts and ill intentions. When faced with difficult situations or challenges, they would rush to join the disbelievers, fearing that misfortune might befall them if they remained with the Muslims. However, the verse suggests that Allah may grant victory to the believers or issue a command that would expose the hypocrites' true intentions, causing them to regret their deceitful ways and feel remorseful for what they had concealed in their hearts.",فترى الذين في قلوبهم مرض يسارعون فيهم يقولون نخشى أن تصيبنا دائرة فعسى الله أن يأتي بالفتح أو أمر من عنده فيصبحوا على ما أسروا في أنفسهم نادمين

Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly professed faith but inwardly concealed disbelief. The believers will express astonishment at how the hypocrites had sworn their strongest oaths claiming to be with the believers, yet their deeds were rendered futile due to their hypocrisy, causing them to be among the ultimate losers on the Day of Judgment.",ويقول الذين آمنوا أهؤلاء الذين أقسموا بالله جهد أيمانهم إنهم لمعكم حبطت أعمالهم فأصبحوا خاسرين
722,5,54,"O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of Allah; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.","This verse is a warning to the believers not to turn away from their faith, otherwise Allah will replace them with a people who are humble towards other believers, stern against the disbelievers, and who strive in Allah's cause without fear of being blamed. It highlights that faith and steadfastness are a great favor from Allah, which He grants to whomever He wills. The verse emphasizes Allah's power, knowledge, and ability to replace any group that deviates from the right path.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا من يرتد منكم عن دينه فسوف يأتي الله بقوم يحبهم ويحبونه أذلة على المؤمنين أعزة على الكافرين يجاهدون في سبيل الله ولا يخافون لومة لائم ذلك فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء والله واسع عليم
723,5,55,"Your guardian and protector is none other than Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe - those who establish prayer and give zakah while bowing down in worship.","The verse emphasizes that the true guardianship and authority lies with Allah, His Messenger Muhammad, and the believers who are obedient to Allah's commands. It specifically highlights the importance of establishing regular prayer and giving obligatory charity (zakah) with humility and devotion, even while bowing down in prayer. This verse instills a sense of loyalty and allegiance to Allah, His Messenger, and the righteous believers who uphold the principles of faith through their actions.",إنما وليكم الله ورسوله والذين آمنوا الذين يقيمون الصلاة ويؤتون الزكاة وهم راكعون
724,5,56,"And whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah is the prevailing.","This verse emphasizes the importance of being allied with Allah, His Messenger, and the believers.

725,5,57,"O you who have believed, do not take those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies. And fear Allah, if you should be believers.","Allah warns the believers against taking as allies or friends those who mock their religion, whether they are from the People of the Scripture who received divine books before the Muslims, or the disbelievers who reject faith entirely. This is because befriending them may lead to being influenced by their disbelief and mockery, which could weaken one's faith. True believers should fear Allah and maintain their allegiance solely to Him.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تتخذوا الذين اتخذوا دينكم هزوا ولعبا من الذين أوتوا الكتاب من قبلكم والكفار أولياء واتقوا الله إن كنتم مؤمنين
726,5,58,"And when you call for prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they are a people who do not use reason.","This verse criticizes those who mock and make fun of the call to prayer (adhan). Their mocking behavior stems from their lack of understanding and reasoning. They are unable to comprehend the significance and wisdom behind the call to prayer, which is a fundamental act of worship in Islam. Their ridicule reflects their ignorance and lack of spiritual insight.",وإذا ناديتم إلى الصلاة اتخذوها هزوا ولعبا ذلك بأنهم قوم لا يعقلون
727,5,59,"Say, ""O People of the Scripture, do you resent us except for believing in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before? And most of you are defiantly disobedient.""","This verse questions the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) about their resentment towards the Muslims, which stems solely from the fact that the Muslims believe in Allah and the revelations sent to them (the Qur'an) as well as the previous revelations. The verse implies that their resentment has no valid basis, and that their disobedience and deviation from the truth is the real reason behind their animosity.",قل يا أهل الكتاب هل تنقمون منا إلا أن آمنا بالله وما أنزل إلينا وما أنزل من قبل وأن أكثركم فاسقون

Those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He became angry, and made of them apes and pigs, and slaves of the Taghut. Such are worse in position and farther astray from the straight path.'","This verse warns against associating partners with Allah and following falsehood. It states that those who earn Allah's curse and anger, are transformed into apes and pigs metaphorically, and become slaves of evil forces (Taghut), are in the worst position and have strayed far from the straight path. This highlights the severe consequences of shirk (associating partners with Allah) and disobedience.",قل هل أنبئكم بشر من ذلك مثوبة عند الله من لعنه الله وغضب عليه وجعل منهم القردة والخنازير وعبد الطاغوت أولئك شر مكانا وأضل عن سواء السبيل

It condemns their evil deeds and warns against following their misguided ways.",وترى كثيرا منهم يسارعون في الإثم والعدوان وأكلهم السحت لبئس ما كانوا يعملون
731,5,63,Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? Evil indeed is what they have been working.,"This verse criticizes the religious scholars (rabbis and priests) for not preventing their followers from engaging in sinful speech and unlawful gains. It condemns their failure to guide people away from evil deeds, suggesting that their inaction makes them complicit in the wrongdoings of their communities.",لولا ينهاهم الربانيون والأحبار عن قولهم الإثم وأكلهم السحت لبئس ما كانوا يصنعون
732,5,64,"The Jews say, ""Allah's Hand is fettered."" Fettered are their hands, and they are cursed for what they have said. Rather, His Hands are outspread; He expendeth how He will.

Whenever they kindle a fire for war, Allah extinguisheth it. They endeavour to work corruption in the earth, and Allah loveth not corrupters.","This verse refutes the blasphemous claim of the Jews that Allah is miserly or incapable of bestowing His bounties. It affirms Allah's infinite power, generosity and freedom to do as He wills. It also warns that the Qur'an's revelation will increase many Jews in arrogance and disbelief due to their obstinacy. Moreover, it states that Allah has sown enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Judgment as a punishment for their transgressions. Whenever they instigate wars, Allah frustrates their efforts. They spread corruption on earth, which Allah abhors.",وقالت اليهود يد الله مغلولة غلت أيديهم ولعنوا بما قالوا بل يداه مبسوطتان ينفق كيف يشاء وليزيدن كثيرا منهم ما أنزل إليك من ربك طغيانا وكفرا وألقينا بينهم العداوة والبغضاء إلى يوم القيامة كلما أوقدوا نارا للحرب أطفأها الله ويسعون في الأرض فسادا والله لا يحب المفسدين

This verse highlights the importance of true faith and righteousness, and that salvation is attainable for all people who sincerely embrace Islam.",ولو أن أهل الكتاب آمنوا واتقوا لكفرنا عنهم سيئاتهم ولأدخلناهم جنات النعيم
734,5,66,"And if only they had upheld the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed provision from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them is a moderate community, but many of them - evil is what they do.","This verse is emphasizing the importance of upholding the teachings of the previous scriptures, the Torah and the Gospel, as well as the Qur'an revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It states that if the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) had truly followed these divine revelations, they would have been blessed with abundant provisions from above and beneath their feet. However, the verse acknowledges that while there is a moderate group among them, many have strayed from the right path and engage in evil deeds.",ولو أنهم أقاموا التوراة والإنجيل وما أنزل إليهم من ربهم لأكلوا من فوقهم ومن تحت أرجلهم منهم أمة مقتصدة وكثير منهم ساء ما يعملون

It warns that the Qur'an, which has been sent down to the Prophet Muhammad, will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief due to their arrogance and rejection of the truth.

Whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party [of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.","This verse refers to the repeated rejection and mistreatment of prophets by the Children of Israel throughout history. Despite Allah taking a covenant from them to follow His messengers, whenever a prophet came with teachings that did not conform to their desires, some of them denied the message, while others even killed the prophets. This highlights their disobedience and ingratitude towards Allah's favors.",لقد أخذنا ميثاق بني إسرائيل وأرسلنا إليهم رسلا كلما جاءهم رسول بما لا تهوى أنفسهم فريقا كذبوا وفريقا يقتلون

They thought that no trials or tribulations would come their way after becoming Muslims. However, they became spiritually blind and deaf, unable to perceive the truth of Islam. Allah then forgave them, giving them another chance, but many of them reverted to their previous state of blindness and deafness, rejecting the guidance.

There are no helpers for the wrongdoers.","This verse refutes the Christian belief that Jesus is God or the son of God. It states that those who make such a claim have disbelieved. The verse then quotes Jesus himself telling the Children of Israel to worship Allah alone, who is his Lord and their Lord.

Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.","This verse clarifies the true nature of Jesus, peace be upon him, and refutes the false beliefs held by some regarding his divinity. It states that he was a messenger of God, like the prophets before him, and that his mother Mary was a truthful and virtuous woman.

This verse invites people to reflect on the clear signs and evidences presented to them, yet they still turn away from the truth and become deluded.",ما المسيح ابن مريم إلا رسول قد خلت من قبله الرسل وأمه صديقة كانا يأكلان الطعام انظر كيف نبين لهم الآيات ثم انظر أنى يؤفكون

And you will surely find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, 'We are Christians.'

It states that the Jews and polytheists (those who associate partners with Allah) will be the most hostile and antagonistic towards the believers. On the other hand, the Christians will be the closest in affection and goodwill towards the believers. This is attributed to the presence of pious and humble priests and monks among the Christians, who are not arrogant or prideful.",لتجدن أشد الناس عداوة للذين آمنوا اليهود والذين أشركوا ولتجدن أقربهم مودة للذين آمنوا الذين قالوا إنا نصارى ذلك بأن منهم قسيسين ورهبانا وأنهم لا يستكبرون

When they listen to the verses revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, their eyes well up with tears out of recognition and appreciation for the truth contained therein. Their reaction stems from a deep conviction in the divine origin and guidance of the Qur'an. They humbly submit to Allah, professing their faith and pleading to be counted among those who bear witness to the truth.",وإذا سمعوا ما أنزل إلى الرسول ترى أعينهم تفيض من الدمع مما عرفوا من الحق يقولون ربنا آمنا فاكتبنا مع الشاهدين

It instructs believers to have two just witnesses from among themselves or, if traveling, two witnesses from outside their community present when making a will or testament upon the approach of death.

These include being supported by the Holy Spirit, speaking from the cradle, being taught the divine scriptures, creating a bird from clay and bringing it to life, healing the blind and lepers, and reviving the dead – all by Allah's permission.

However, this would have caused confusion and doubt among the disbelievers, just as they are confused about the Prophet Muhammad being a human messenger. The wisdom behind sending human messengers is that people can relate to them better and follow their example more easily.",ولو جعلناه ملكا لجعلناه رجلا وللبسنا عليهم ما يلبسون
798,6,10,"And certainly were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.","This verse reminds the Prophet Muhammad that he is not the first messenger to face mockery and ridicule from disbelievers. Many messengers before him were also mocked and derided by their people. However, those who mocked the messengers ultimately faced the very punishment or consequences that they used to ridicule and make fun of. This serves as a warning to those who reject the message and mock the messenger, for their mockery will not prevent the truth from prevailing, and they will face the consequences of their disbelief.",ولقد استهزئ برسل من قبلك فحاق بالذين سخروا منهم ما كانوا به يستهزئون
799,6,11,"Say, ""Travel through the land and observe how was the end of the deniers.""","This verse encourages people to reflect on the fate of previous nations and communities who rejected the message of God's messengers. By traveling and observing the remnants of these civilizations, one can see the consequences of denying the truth and turning away from God's guidance. It serves as a reminder that those who arrogantly reject faith and persist in disbelief will ultimately face a similar end, just as those before them did.",قل سيروا في الأرض ثم انظروا كيف كان عاقبة المكذبين
800,6,12,"Say, ""To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""To Allah."" He has prescribed for Himself mercy. He will surely gather you for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.",الله تعالى يأمر نبيه محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يقول للمشركين: لمن تنتمي كل ما في السماوات والأرض؟ فالجواب هو لله وحده. ثم يأمره أن يقول إن الله كتب على نفسه الرحمة، فسيجمع الخلائق يوم القيامة ليحاسبهم وليدخل من آمن الجنة ومن كفر النار. وهذا اليوم لا شك فيه، لكن الذين خسروا أنفسهم بالكفر والمعاصي لن يؤمنوا به.,قل لمن ما في السماوات والأرض قل لله كتب على نفسه الرحمة ليجمعنكم إلى يوم القيامة لا ريب فيه الذين خسروا أنفسهم فهم لا يؤمنون
801,6,13,"To Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day. And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.","This verse affirms Allah's complete sovereignty and dominion over all of creation. Everything that exists, whether living or non-living, moving or still, during the night or day, is under His ownership and control. Allah is ""As-Samee'"" (the All-Hearing), aware of the slightest sound or movement, and ""Al-'Aleem"" (the All-Knowing), possessing perfect and comprehensive knowledge of all things, seen and unseen.",وله ما سكن في الليل والنهار وهو السميع العليم
802,6,14,"Say: ""Shall I take besides Allah another guardian, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds but is not fed?"" Say: ""I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit."" And be not thou of the idolaters.","Allah is questioning the idolaters who worship other gods besides Him. He is the sole Creator and Sustainer of the universe, so how can they take others as gods besides Him? The Prophet Muhammad is commanded to declare that he has submitted himself completely to Allah alone and to be the first among those who surrender to His will, rejecting all forms of idolatry or associating partners with Allah.",قل أغير الله أتخذ وليا فاطر السماوات والأرض وهو يطعم ولا يطعم قل إني أمرت أن أكون أول من أسلم ولا تكونن من المشركين
803,6,15,"Say, ""Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.""","This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah and the fear of His punishment. It encourages the believer to remain steadfast in their faith and avoid disobedience, as the consequences of defying Allah's commands on the Day of Judgment will be severe and overwhelming. The ""tremendous Day"" refers to the Day of Resurrection, when all humans will be held accountable for their actions.",قل إني أخاف إن عصيت ربي عذاب يوم عظيم
804,6,16,Whoever is spared from it that Day - [Allah] has certainly favoured him. And that is the clear success.,"Whoever is saved from the punishment and torment of Hell on the Day of Resurrection, Allah has truly shown him mercy and blessed him with His grace. This salvation from Hellfire is the supreme triumph and evident success that every believer aspires for.",من يصرف عنه يومئذ فقد رحمه وذلك الفوز المبين
805,6,17,"And if Allah should touch you with affliction, none can remove it but He. And if He touches you with good - then He is over all things competent.","This verse emphasizes the absolute power and control of Allah over all affairs. It states that if Allah afflicts a person with harm or difficulty, none other than Him can remove or alleviate that affliction. Similarly, if He blesses a person with goodness and favors, it is because He has the complete ability to do so over all things. The verse highlights Allah's Oneness, might, and sovereignty over the universe and human affairs.",وإن يمسسك الله بضر فلا كاشف له إلا هو وإن يمسسك بخير فهو على كل شيء قدير
806,6,18,"And He is the Irresistible, over His servants, and He is the Wise, the Acquainted.","This verse emphasizes Allah's supreme authority and power over His creation, as well as His perfect wisdom and knowledge. He is ""Al-Qaahir"" (the Irresistible), meaning that none can overpower or resist His will and decree. At the same time, He is ""Al-Hakeem"" (the Wise), executing everything with profound wisdom and purpose, and ""Al-Khabeer"" (the Acquainted), possessing complete knowledge of all things, seen and unseen. This highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty, might, and wisdom in governing the affairs of His servants and the entire universe.",وهو القاهر فوق عباده وهو الحكيم الخبير
807,6,19,"Say, ""What thing is greatest in testimony?"" Say, ""Allah is Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches. Do you verily bear witness that there are other gods with Allah?"" Say, ""I bear no witness."" Say, ""He is but One God, and I am surely free of that which you associate.""","This verse invites people to reflect on the greatest testimony, which is the testimony of Allah Himself. It emphasizes that the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad to warn people and guide them to the truth. The verse then questions whether people truly believe in the existence of other gods besides Allah. It instructs the Prophet to declare that he does not bear witness to the existence of any other gods and that Allah is One and Unique, free from any partners or associates.",قل أي شيء أكبر شهادة قل الله شهيد بيني وبينكم وأوحي إلي هذا القرآن لأنذركم به ومن بلغ أئنكم لتشهدون أن مع الله آلهة أخرى قل لا أشهد قل إنما هو إله واحد وإنني بريء مما تشركون
808,6,20,Those to whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their own sons. Those who have lost themselves will not believe.,"This verse refers to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who recognized the truth of the Prophet Muhammad, upon him be peace, and the message he brought, just as they would recognize their own sons. However, those who have lost or ruined themselves by rejecting the truth and following their desires will not believe, despite recognizing the truth.",الذين آتيناهم الكتاب يعرفونه كما يعرفون أبناءهم الذين خسروا أنفسهم فهم لا يؤمنون
809,6,21,"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or denies His verses? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.",This verse condemns those who fabricate lies against Allah or reject His revelations. It warns that such unjust individuals who spread falsehood about Allah and His signs will ultimately fail and not attain success or salvation. Their wrongful actions will lead them to ruin and deprivation of Allah's mercy and guidance.,ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو كذب بآياته إنه لا يفلح الظالمون
810,6,22,"And the Day when We will gather them all together - then We will say to those who associated others with Allah, ""Where are your 'partners' that you used to claim?""","This verse refers to the Day of Judgment when Allah will gather all people, and question the polytheists about the partners they associated with Him. It emphasizes the futility of their beliefs and the fact that their so-called partners will be unable to help them on that Day. The verse highlights the oneness of Allah and the falsehood of associating others with Him.",ويوم نحشرهم جميعا ثم نقول للذين أشركوا أين شركاؤكم الذين كنتم تزعمون
811,6,23,"But they had no excuse except that they said, 'By Allah, our Lord, we have never been idolaters.'","The interpretation of this verse is that the disbelievers had no valid justification or excuse for their rejection of faith and association of partners with Allah, except their false claim that they worshipped Allah alone and were not idolaters. However, this claim was a clear lie, as they associated others with Allah in worship, which is the essence of shirk (polytheism).",ثم لم تكن فتنتهم إلا أن قالوا والله ربنا ما كنا مشركين
812,6,24,"See how they lied against themselves, and how that which they used to invent has gone away from them.","This verse highlights the falsehood and deception that the disbelievers engaged in, rejecting the truth and inventing lies against Allah. It emphasizes that their false claims and fabrications will ultimately be exposed and become worthless, leaving them with nothing but their own self-deception. The verse serves as a warning against arrogance, denial of the truth, and the futility of following one's own whims and desires instead of the guidance from Allah.",انظر كيف كذبوا على أنفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون
813,6,25,"And among them are those who listen to you, but We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if they should see every sign, they still would not believe in it. Even when they come to you arguing with you, those who disbelieve say, 'This is not but legends of the former peoples.'","This verse describes the stubborn disbelief of some people who refuse to accept the truth despite clear signs and proofs. Their hearts are covered, preventing them from understanding the message, and their ears are deaf to it. Even if they witness every miracle, they still would not believe. When they argue with the Prophet, they dismiss the Qur'an as mere fables of ancient peoples, rejecting its divine origin.",ومنهم من يستمع إليك وجعلنا على قلوبهم أكنة أن يفقهوه وفي آذانهم وقرا وإن يروا كل آية لا يؤمنوا بها حتى إذا جاءوك يجادلونك يقول الذين كفروا إن هذا إلا أساطير الأولين

They distance themselves from the truth and refuse to accept it, leading to their own spiritual and moral destruction. However, they fail to comprehend the consequences of their actions and the harm they inflict upon themselves.",وهم ينهون عنه وينأون عنه وإن يهلكون إلا أنفسهم وما يشعرون
815,6,27,"And if you could but see when they will be held over the Fire and will say, 'Would that we might be returned [to the former world]! Then we would not deny the signs of our Lord, and we would be among the believers.'","This verse depicts the regretful state of the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment when they will be brought before the Hellfire. They will wish to be sent back to the worldly life so that they could believe and obey Allah's commands, realizing too late the grave error of their ways. However, this remorse will be of no avail as their opportunity has passed. The verse serves as a stern warning to take heed in this life before it is too late.",ولو ترى إذ وقفوا على النار فقالوا يا ليتنا نرد ولا نكذب بآيات ربنا ونكون من المؤمنين
816,6,28,"Nay, but that which they used to conceal before has become manifest to them. And if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And most certainly they are liars.","This verse indicates that the disbelievers' true nature and real intentions have been exposed. If they were given another chance in this life, they would revert to the same sinful acts that they were prohibited from doing. They are proven liars who have broken their promises and covenants with Allah.",بل بدا لهم ما كانوا يخفون من قبل ولو ردوا لعادوا لما نهوا عنه وإنهم لكاذبون
817,6,29,"And they say, 'There is nothing but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected.'","This verse refers to the disbelief of those who deny the Hereafter and the resurrection. They limit their understanding to the physical world and material life, rejecting the idea of a life after death or accountability before God. Their perspective is confined to this temporary worldly existence, failing to recognize the greater spiritual reality and purpose of human existence.",وقالوا إن هي إلا حياتنا الدنيا وما نحن بمبعوثين
818,6,30,"And if you could but see when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, 'Is this not the truth?' They will say, 'Yes, by our Lord.' He will then say, 'So taste the punishment for what you used to deny.'","This verse describes the scene on the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers will be brought before Allah. Allah will ask them if what they are witnessing is not the truth, and they will be forced to admit that it is indeed the truth. As a consequence of their denial and disbelief in the worldly life, Allah will command them to taste the punishment they deserved.",ولو ترى إذ وقفوا على ربهم قال أليس هذا بالحق قالوا بلى وربنا قال فذوقوا العذاب بما كنتم تكفرون
819,6,31,"Indeed, they who denied the meeting with Allah will have lost, until, when the Hour comes upon them unexpectedly, they will say, 'Oh, [how great is] our regret over what we neglected concerning it.' And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.","This verse warns those who deny the reality of the Hereafter and the accountability before Allah. It states that they will be in a state of loss and regret when the Hour suddenly arrives. At that moment, they will realize their grave mistake in neglecting their duties, but it will be too late. The burdens of their sins will weigh heavily upon them, and what they carried in this life will be a source of immense distress in the Hereafter. The verse emphasizes the dire consequences of denying the meeting with Allah and highlights the importance of faith and righteous deeds.",قد خسر الذين كذبوا بلقاء الله حتى إذا جاءتهم الساعة بغتة قالوا يا حسرتنا على ما فرطنا فيها وهم يحملون أوزارهم على ظهورهم ألا ساء ما يزرون
820,6,32,And what is the life of this world but play and amusement? But far better is the Abode of the Hereafter for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand?,"This verse emphasizes the temporary and fleeting nature of this worldly life, which is likened to mere play and amusement. It contrasts this with the everlasting life of the Hereafter, which is described as ""far better"" for those who lead a righteous life by obeying Allah's commands and avoiding His prohibitions. The verse concludes with a rhetorical question, urging people to use their intellect and understand the profound truth that the real, eternal life is the one in the Hereafter, not this transient worldly existence.",وما الحياة الدنيا إلا لعب ولهو وللدار الآخرة خير للذين يتقون أفلا تعقلون
821,6,33,"We certainly know that what they say grieves you. But they do not call you a liar; rather, it is the signs of Allah that the wrongdoers reject.","This verse is a consolation for the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the rejection and mockery he faced from the disbelievers. It states that Allah knows the hurt and grief caused by their words, but they are not accusing the Prophet himself of lying. Rather, they are denying and rejecting the clear signs and revelations from Allah out of injustice and wrongdoing.",قد نعلم إنه ليحزنك الذي يقولون فإنهم لا يكذبونك ولكن الظالمين بآيات الله يجحدون

And none can alter the words of Allah. And there has certainly come to you the news of the [former] messengers.","This verse reminds the Prophet Muhammad that he is not the first messenger to face rejection and persecution. Many messengers before him were also denied and suffered harm from their people, but they remained patient and steadfast until Allah's help and victory came to them. It emphasizes that Allah's words and promises are unchangeable, and that the stories of previous messengers have reached the Prophet as a lesson and consolation.",ولقد كذبت رسل من قبلك فصبروا على ما كذبوا وأوذوا حتى أتاهم نصرنا ولا مبدل لكلمات الله ولقد جاءك من نبإ المرسلين

And had Allah willed, He could have gathered them to guidance. So do not be among the ignorant.","La interprétation de ce verset est que le Prophète ne doit pas se sentir découragé par ceux qui se détournent de la vérité. S'il était possible d'obtenir un miracle évident de la terre ou du ciel pour les convaincre, alors peut-être qu'ils croiraient. Cependant, Allah ne force personne à croire. C'est Son choix de guider ou non les gens. Le Prophète ne doit donc pas être parmi les ignorants qui s'obstinent malgré les preuves évidentes.",وإن كان كبر عليك إعراضهم فإن استطعت أن تبتغي نفقا في الأرض أو سلما في السماء فتأتيهم بآية ولو شاء الله لجمعهم على الهدى فلا تكونن من الجاهلين

Those who are spiritually ""dead"" and unwilling to listen will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and held accountable for their actions. Ultimately, all will return to God for judgment and recompense.",إنما يستجيب الذين يسمعون والموتى يبعثهم الله ثم إليه يرجعون
825,6,37,"And they say, 'Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'Indeed, Allah is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.'","The disbelievers demanded a miracle from the Prophet as proof of his prophethood, but Allah says that He has the power to send down miracles, however, most people are ignorant and would still not believe even if a miracle was shown to them.

Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray, and whoever He wills He guides to a straight path.","This verse highlights the spiritual blindness and deafness of those who reject Allah's revelations. They are likened to being in utter darkness, unable to perceive the truth. It also emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty, where He guides whom He wills to the straight path and leaves whom He wills to stray, based on His divine wisdom and justice.",والذين كذبوا بآياتنا صم وبكم في الظلمات من يشإ الله يضلله ومن يشأ يجعله على صراط مستقيم
828,6,40,"Say, 'Have you considered: if there came to you the punishment of Allah or there came to you the Hour - is it other than Allah you would invoke, if you should be truthful?'","This verse questions the polytheists' beliefs and practices. It asks them to ponder: if Allah's punishment or the Day of Resurrection were to come upon them, would they call upon anyone other than Allah for help and salvation? If they are truthful in their claim of associating partners with Allah, then they should be able to find someone else to call upon during such calamities. However, the implied answer is that they would have no one else to turn to except Allah, thus proving the falsehood of their polytheistic beliefs.",قل أرأيتكم إن أتاكم عذاب الله أو أتتكم الساعة أغير الله تدعون إن كنتم صادقين
829,6,41,"Nay, it is He alone Whom you call upon, and He removes that for which you call upon Him if He wills, and you forget whatever partners you ascribed to Him.","This verse emphasizes that it is Allah alone who has the power to answer prayers and remove difficulties. Calling upon any partners or false deities besides Allah is futile, as they have no ability to help or respond. The verse reminds people that they tend to forget their false partners when they are in dire need and sincerely call upon Allah alone for help.",بل إياه تدعون فيكشف ما تدعون إليه إن شاء وتنسون ما تشركون
830,6,42,"And We have certainly sent [messengers] to nations before you, [O Muhammad]; then We seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves [to Us].","Allah sent messengers to nations before the time of Prophet Muhammad to guide them, but when they rejected the message, He punished them with poverty, hardship and calamities so that they may humble themselves before Him and submit to His commands.",ولقد أرسلنا إلى أمم من قبلك فأخذناهم بالبأساء والضراء لعلهم يتضرعون

Despite being reminded, they forgot Allah's favors and indulged in worldly pleasures. As a result, Allah opened for them ""the gates of all things,"" meaning they were given abundant provisions and material comforts. However, when they became arrogant and rejoiced in these worldly gains, Allah seized them suddenly with a severe punishment, leaving them in utter regret and despair.",فلما نسوا ما ذكروا به فتحنا عليهم أبواب كل شيء حتى إذا فرحوا بما أوتوا أخذناهم بغتة فإذا هم مبلسون

Look how We diversify the verses; then they [still] turn away.","This verse warns the disbelievers of the consequences of rejecting faith and guidance from Allah. It emphasizes Allah's power to deprive them of their faculties of hearing, sight, and understanding, leaving them spiritually blind and deaf. No other deity can restore these blessings if Allah chooses to take them away. The verse also highlights Allah's wisdom in presenting clear signs and evidences, yet the disbelievers persist in turning away from the truth.",قل أرأيتم إن أخذ الله سمعكم وأبصاركم وختم على قلوبكم من إله غير الله يأتيكم به انظر كيف نصرف الآيات ثم هم يصدفون

It serves as a reminder that Allah's punishment is just and befalls those who persist in disbelief and wrongdoing. The verse emphasizes the importance of faith and righteous conduct to avoid such a dire consequence.",قل أرأيتكم إن أتاكم عذاب الله بغتة أو جهرة هل يهلك إلا القوم الظالمون

He then informs them that He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself, meaning that He will forgive those who commit sins out of ignorance, not defiantly, if they repent sincerely and reform themselves.

845,6,57,"Say, ""I am on clear evidence from my Lord, and you have denied it. I do not have what you are impatient for. The decision is only for Allah. He relates the truth, and He is the best of judges.""","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad to declare that he has clear proof and guidance from Allah, while the disbelievers have rejected it. He does not possess the punishment they are demanding to be brought upon them hastily.

Instead of arguing or retaliating, they are advised to walk away and disengage from such conversations until the subject changes. However, if they forget and find themselves in the company of those who persist in wrongdoing after being reminded, they should remove themselves from that situation. The verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining dignity, avoiding futile arguments, and distancing oneself from those who deliberately disrespect the divine revelations.",وإذا رأيت الذين يخوضون في آياتنا فأعرض عنهم حتى يخوضوا في حديث غيره وإما ينسينك الشيطان فلا تقعد بعد الذكرى مع القوم الظالمين

864,6,76,"So when the night covered him over, he saw a star. He said, 'This is my lord.' But when it set, he said, 'I do not like those that set.'","The verse describes Prophet Abraham's search for the true Lord and his rejection of worshipping celestial objects like stars, which rise and set. It teaches that the true Lord is eternal and does not undergo changes like rising or setting. The verse highlights Abraham's intellectual journey and his reasoning in rejecting the worship of transient celestial bodies.",فلما جن عليه الليل رأى كوكبا قال هذا ربي فلما أفل قال لا أحب الآفلين

By ""setting his face"" towards the Creator, he declares his unwavering devotion and submission to the One True God, Who created the heavens and the earth. The term ""hanifa"" means inclining towards the truth and avoiding falsehood, indicating his commitment to the pure monotheistic faith. His statement ""I am not of those who associate partners with Allah"" is a clear renunciation of shirk, the association of any partners or equals with God, which is considered the gravest sin in Islam.",إني وجهت وجهي للذي فطر السماوات والأرض حنيفا وما أنا من المشركين

Allah is asking which party deserves to feel secure - the believers who worship Allah alone or the polytheists who associate partners with Him without any justification. This verse emphasizes the falsehood of polytheism and the importance of worshipping Allah alone based on evidence and authority revealed by Him.",وكيف أخاف ما أشركتم ولا تخافون أنكم أشركتم بالله ما لم ينزل به عليكم سلطانا فأي الفريقين أحق بالأمن إن كنتم تعلمون

He guides whomever He wills from among His servants to the straight path. However, if they had associated partners with Allah in worship, all their good deeds would have been rendered void and fruitless, as shirk (associating others with Allah) nullifies all good deeds.",ذلك هدى الله يهدي به من يشاء من عباده ولو أشركوا لحبط عنهم ما كانوا يعملون

It reminds them of the revelation given to Prophet Moses, which was a source of light and guidance. Yet they treat it selectively, revealing parts and concealing others, and were taught knowledge they did not previously possess. It commands the Prophet to affirm that it is God who revealed these scriptures, and to leave those who deny in their idle talk and amusement.",وما قدروا الله حق قدره إذ قالوا ما أنزل الله على بشر من شيء قل من أنزل الكتاب الذي جاء به موسى نورا وهدى للناس تجعلونه قراطيس تبدونها وتخفون كثيرا وعلمتم ما لم تعلموا أنتم ولا آباؤكم قل الله ثم ذرهم في خوضهم يلعبون

Attributing partners or offspring to Allah is a grave sin done out of ignorance and lack of knowledge about His Oneness and Transcendence.",وجعلوا لله شركاء الجن وخلقهم وخرقوا له بنين وبنات بغير علم سبحانه وتعالى عما يصفون
889,6,101,"The Originator of the heavens and the earth - how could He have a son when He has no wife? He created all things, and He is the Knower of all things.","This verse denies the notion that God has a son or offspring, as He is the Creator of all things and does not have a spouse or partner. It affirms God's Oneness and His transcendence above any human attributes or relationships. The verse emphasizes that God is the sole Creator and Sustainer of the entire universe, and He has perfect knowledge of all His creation.",بديع السماوات والأرض أنى يكون له ولد ولم تكن له صاحبة وخلق كل شيء وهو بكل شيء عليم
890,6,102,"That is Allah, your Lord; there is no deity except Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is Disposer of all things.","This verse affirms the Oneness of Allah and His sole right to be worshipped. It emphasizes that Allah is the Creator of all things, and therefore, He alone deserves to be worshipped and obeyed. The verse also highlights Allah's attribute of being the ""Wakil"" or Disposer of all affairs, meaning that He is in complete control and authority over all matters.",ذلكم الله ربكم لا إله إلا هو خالق كل شيء فاعبدوه وهو على كل شيء وكيل
891,6,103,"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. And He is the Most Subtle and Courteous, All-Aware.","This verse emphasizes the transcendence and incomprehensibility of Allah to human faculties. It states that no physical eye can perceive or encompass Allah's essence, as He is beyond the limitations of human senses and comprehension. However, Allah encompasses and comprehends all vision and perception. The verse also attributes to Allah the qualities of being ""Al-Lateef"" (The Most Subtle and Courteous) and ""Al-Khabeer"" (The All-Aware). These attributes highlight Allah's infinite knowledge, wisdom, and subtle dealings with His creation.",لا تدركه الأبصار وهو يدرك الأبصار وهو اللطيف الخبير
892,6,104,"There has come to you enlightenment from your Lord. So whoever will see, it is for [the benefit of] his soul; and whoever is blind, it is to its detriment. And I am not a keeper over you.","Allah says that clear proofs and guidance have come to humanity from Him. Those who choose to be guided by this enlightenment will benefit themselves, and those who choose to remain blind and reject it will only harm themselves. The Messenger's role is only to convey the message, not to force people to accept it. The choice is theirs, and the consequences lie solely upon them.",قد جاءكم بصائر من ربكم فمن أبصر فلنفسه ومن عمي فعليها وما أنا عليكم بحفيظ
893,6,105,"And thus do We explain the verses so that they will say, 'You have studied,' and that We may make it clear for a people who know.","This verse indicates that Allah explains the verses of the Qur'an in different ways and with various examples so that people can understand them clearly. The disbelievers may accuse the Prophet of studying with others to gain knowledge, but Allah clarifies that He is the One who makes the verses clear for those who have knowledge and seek guidance.",وكذلك نصرف الآيات وليقولوا درست ولنبينه لقوم يعلمون
894,6,106,Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord - there is no deity except Him - and turn away from those who associate others with Allah.,"This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to follow the divine revelation sent to him by Allah, acknowledging that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone. It also commands him to disregard and turn away from those who associate partners with Allah in worship.",اتبع ما أوحي إليك من ربك لا إله إلا هو وأعرض عن المشركين
895,6,107,"And if Allah had willed, they would not have associated. And We have not appointed you over them as a guardian, nor are you a wakil over them.","This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and that He alone has the power to guide people to the truth or let them go astray. It states that if Allah had willed, the idolaters would not have associated partners with Him. However, He has given humans free will to choose their path. The Prophet Muhammad is told that he is not a guardian or custodian over them, nor a ""wakil"" which means a disposer of their affairs or one who has power over them. His role is to convey the message, but their guidance is ultimately up to Allah.",ولو شاء الله ما أشركوا وما جعلناك عليهم حفيظا وما أنت عليهم بوكيل
896,6,108,"And do not insult those they invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge. Thus We have made pleasing to every community their deeds. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they used to do.","This verse teaches Muslims to avoid insulting the deities or objects of worship of other religions, as that may provoke them to insult Allah in retaliation out of ignorance. Each community has been made to find their own religious practices pleasing, but ultimately all will return to Allah, who will inform them of the reality of their deeds.",ولا تسبوا الذين يدعون من دون الله فيسبوا الله عدوا بغير علم كذلك زينا لكل أمة عملهم ثم إلى ربهم مرجعهم فينبئهم بما كانوا يعملون
897,6,109,"And they swore by Allah with their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would surely believe in it. Say, 'The signs are only with Allah, and what will make you perceive that even if it should come, they would not believe?'","This verse highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers. They claimed that if a miracle or sign was shown to them, they would believe. However, Allah knows that even if a sign came to them, they would still reject it due to their arrogance and closed-mindedness. The verse emphasizes that true guidance comes from Allah, and no amount of signs or miracles can guide those who are unwilling to open their hearts and minds to the truth.",وأقسموا بالله جهد أيمانهم لئن جاءتهم آية ليؤمنن بها قل إنما الآيات عند الله وما يشعركم أنها إذا جاءت لا يؤمنون
898,6,110,"And We will turn their hearts and vision upside down as they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them wandering blindly in their rebellion.","Allah threatens those who rejected faith that He will turn their hearts and vision away from guidance, just as they turned away from believing when it was presented to them initially. They will be left to wander aimlessly in their transgression and misguidance, unable to find the right path.",ونقلب أفئدتهم وأبصارهم كما لم يؤمنوا به أول مرة ونذرهم في طغيانهم يعمهون
899,6,111,"And even if We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered together all things before them, they still would not have believed unless Allah willed. But most of them are ignorant.","This verse emphasizes that mere miracles and signs are not enough to make someone believe. Even if angels descended, the dead spoke, and all proofs were presented before them, they would still not believe unless Allah willed them to believe and guided them. Their disbelief stems from their own ignorance and stubbornness, not a lack of evidence or proof.",ولو أننا نزلنا إليهم الملائكة وكلمهم الموتى وحشرنا عليهم كل شيء قبلا ما كانوا ليؤمنوا إلا أن يشاء الله ولكن أكثرهم يجهلون
900,6,112,"And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - the devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and what they invent.","Allah says that He has ordained for every prophet to face opposition and enmity from evil humans and jinn who whisper deceptive words to one another to lead people astray. However, if Allah had willed, they would not have been able to do this. But He allows it as a test for people. Therefore, the Prophet is commanded to ignore them and their fabrications against him.",وكذلك جعلنا لكل نبي عدوا شياطين الإنس والجن يوحي بعضهم إلى بعض زخرف القول غرورا ولو شاء ربك ما فعلوه فذرهم وما يفترون
901,6,113,"And let those who do not believe in the Hereafter listen to it, and let them be pleased with it, and let them commit whatever deeds they are committing.","This verse suggests that the disbelievers should listen to the Qur'an, even though they do not believe in the Hereafter or the accountability on the Day of Judgment. They are being given a chance to accept the truth, but if they reject it, they will be held accountable for their misdeeds and wrongful actions.",ولتصغى إليه أفئدة الذين لا يؤمنون بالآخرة وليرضوه وليقترفوا ما هم مقترفون
902,6,114,"Is it other than Allah I should seek as judge when it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail? Those to whom We gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in truth, so never be among the doubters.","This verse emphasizes that Allah alone is the true Judge and Legislator, and that His revelation in the Qur'an is the ultimate source of guidance and truth. It affirms that those who have been given knowledge of previous Scriptures recognize the Qur'an as the truth from their Lord. Therefore, one should not doubt or hesitate in accepting and submitting to Allah's commandments.",أفغير الله أبتغي حكما وهو الذي أنزل إليكم الكتاب مفصلا والذين آتيناهم الكتاب يعلمون أنه منزل من ربك بالحق فلا تكونن من الممترين
903,6,115,"And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.","This verse emphasizes the immutability of Allah's Words and Decrees. It affirms that Allah's Promise and Threat will inevitably come to pass without any alteration or change. His Words are true, just, and infallible, as He is the All-Hearing, who hears all that is said, and the All-Knowing, who knows everything in the most perfect manner.",وتمت كلمت ربك صدقا وعدلا لا مبدل لكلماته وهو السميع العليم
904,6,116,"And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.","This verse warns against blindly following the majority or the prevalent views and customs of people, as they are often based on mere assumptions, conjectures, and falsehoods rather than the truth revealed by Allah. It emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance from Allah alone and not being misled by the whims and desires of the masses, who mainly follow their own assumptions and make up lies and false claims.",وإن تطع أكثر من في الأرض يضلوك عن سبيل الله إن يتبعون إلا الظن وإن هم إلا يخرصون
905,6,117,"Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has gone astray from His way, and He is most knowing of those who are guided.","This verse indicates that Allah alone has perfect knowledge of those who deviate from the right path and those who are rightly guided. It emphasizes Allah's absolute and encompassing knowledge, reminding us that He is fully aware of the spiritual condition and choices of every individual. The interpretation highlights Allah's supreme wisdom and authority in judging who is misguided and who is following the true path.",إن ربك هو أعلم من يضل عن سبيله وهو أعلم بالمهتدين
906,6,118,"So eat of that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you are believers in His signs.","Allah commands the believers to eat from the lawful and permissible foods, upon which His name has been invoked during slaughter. This verse emphasizes the importance of acknowledging Allah's blessings and following His commands, as a sign of true faith and belief in His revelations and signs.",فكلوا مما ذكر اسم الله عليه إن كنتم بآياته مؤمنين
907,6,119,"And what is [the matter] with you that you do not eat from that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, while He has explained in detail to you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you are compelled? And indeed do many lead [others] astray by their [own] inclinations without knowledge. Indeed, your Lord - He is most knowing of the transgressors.",الله تعالى يعاتب المؤمنين لتركهم أكل ما ذُكر اسم الله عليه من الطعام الحلال، مع أنه قد بين لهم بالتفصيل ما حرم عليهم إلا ما اضطروا إليه من المحرمات. وإن كثيرًا من الناس يضلون غيرهم بأهوائهم الباطلة من غير علم بالحق، فالله تعالى هو أعلم بالمعتدين على حدوده وشرعه.,وما لكم ألا تأكلوا مما ذكر اسم الله عليه وقد فصل لكم ما حرم عليكم إلا ما اضطررتم إليه وإن كثيرا ليضلون بأهوائهم بغير علم إن ربك هو أعلم بالمعتدين
908,6,120,And leave what is outward of sin and what is inward thereof. Surely those who earn sin will be recompensed for what they used to commit.,"This verse instructs believers to avoid all forms of sin, whether apparent or hidden, as those who engage in sinful acts will be held accountable and receive due recompense for their misdeeds. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining purity and righteousness in both outward actions and inward intentions.",وذروا ظاهر الإثم وباطنه إن الذين يكسبون الإثم سيجزون بما كانوا يقترفون
909,6,121,"And do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. And indeed do the shayatin (devils) inspire their allies to dispute with you. But if you were to obey them, indeed you would then be those who associate others with Allah.","This verse prohibits eating food over which Allah's name has not been pronounced before slaughtering the animal. It warns that doing so is a grave sin and disobedience. The verse also mentions that the devils inspire their allies to argue with believers about this matter, tempting them to disobey this command. If believers obey the devils in this, they would be associating partners with Allah, which is a form of shirk or polytheism.",ولا تأكلوا مما لم يذكر اسم الله عليه وإنه لفسق وإن الشياطين ليوحون إلى أوليائهم ليجادلوكم وإن أطعتموهم إنكم لمشركون
910,6,122,"Is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness, never to emerge therefrom? Thus is made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they used to do.","This verse draws a metaphorical comparison between the believer who has been guided to faith and the disbeliever who remains in misguidance. The one who was ""dead"" spiritually and then given life through faith is likened to one who walks with light, while the disbeliever is like one trapped in darkness, unable to find the way out. The pleasing delusions of their misdeeds are made attractive to the disbelievers, just as the light guides the believer.",أومن كان ميتا فأحييناه وجعلنا له نورا يمشي به في الناس كمن مثله في الظلمات ليس بخارج منها كذلك زين للكافرين ما كانوا يعملون

They plot and scheme against the believers, thinking they are harming them, but in reality they are only harming themselves. However, they are unaware of the consequences of their evil actions.",وكذلك جعلنا في كل قرية أكابر مجرميها ليمكروا فيها وما يمكرون إلا بأنفسهم وما يشعرون

Allah is most knowing of where to place His message. There will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before Allah and a severe punishment for what they used to conspire.","This verse criticizes the arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers. When presented with evidence from the Qur'an, they arrogantly demand miracles like those given to previous prophets, rejecting faith until their unreasonable demands are met. It warns that those who persist in such defiance and mockery will face humiliation and severe punishment from Allah for their evil plots against the truth.",وإذا جاءتهم آية قالوا لن نؤمن حتى نؤتى مثل ما أوتي رسل الله الله أعلم حيث يجعل رسالته سيصيب الذين أجرموا صغار عند الله وعذاب شديد بما كانوا يمكرون

Thus does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe.","Allah guides whomever He wills by opening their hearts to Islam, making it easy for them to accept faith. But for those He wills to go astray, He makes their hearts tight and constricted, making it extremely difficult for them to accept guidance - as difficult as ascending to the sky. This is how Allah allows disbelief and wickedness to overcome those who reject faith.",فمن يرد الله أن يهديه يشرح صدره للإسلام ومن يرد أن يضله يجعل صدره ضيقا حرجا كأنما يصعد في السماء كذلك يجعل الله الرجس على الذين لا يؤمنون
914,6,126,"And this is the path of your Lord, leading straight. We have certainly explained the verses for a people who will remember.","This verse emphasizes that the path outlined in the Qur'an is the straight and true path prescribed by Allah. The verses have been explained in detail, leaving no ambiguity, so that those who reflect and ponder upon them may derive guidance and benefit from them. It is a call to follow the clear and unwavering path set forth by the Divine, and to be among those who remember and heed the profound truths revealed in the Qur'anic verses.",وهذا صراط ربك مستقيما قد فصلنا الآيات لقوم يذكرون

This is a reward from Allah for their righteous deeds and obedience to Him in this world. Allah will be their ""Protecting Friend"" (walī), meaning He will be their Guardian, Helper, and Supporter, because of their good actions and faith.",لهم دار السلام عند ربهم وهو وليهم بما كانوا يعملون
916,6,128,"And the Day He will gather them all together [and say]: 'O company of jinn! You have misled many among mankind.'

He will say: 'The Fire is your home; you will abide therein forever, except what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.'","This verse describes the scene on the Day of Judgment when Allah will gather all humans and jinn together. He will address the jinn and rebuke them for misleading many humans. The misguided humans will acknowledge that they mutually misled each other, but they have now reached the appointed term. Allah will then decree that the Fire of Hell will be their eternal abode, except for those whom He wills to exempt by His wisdom and knowledge.",ويوم يحشرهم جميعا يا معشر الجن قد استكثرتم من الإنس وقال أولياؤهم من الإنس ربنا استمتع بعضنا ببعض وبلغنا أجلنا الذي أجلت لنا قال النار مثواكم خالدين فيها إلا ما شاء الله إن ربك حكيم عليم

They will say, 'We bear witness against ourselves,' and the life of this world deluded them, and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.","Allah addresses the jinn and humans on the Day of Judgment, questioning them if messengers did not come to them from among themselves, reciting the verses of Allah and warning them about the accountability on this Day. They will admit that messengers did come, bearing witness against themselves that they rejected the truth. The temporary delights of the worldly life deluded them, causing them to deny the truth and become disbelievers.",يا معشر الجن والإنس ألم يأتكم رسل منكم يقصون عليكم آياتي وينذرونكم لقاء يومكم هذا قالوا شهدنا على أنفسنا وغرتهم الحياة الدنيا وشهدوا على أنفسهم أنهم كانوا كافرين

If He wills, He can destroy you and replace you with whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the seed of another people.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute power, self-sufficiency, and mercy. He is not in need of anyone or anything, yet He bestows His mercy upon His creation. If He wills, He can eliminate humanity and replace them with a new creation, just as He brought forth the present generation from the descendants of previous peoples. This serves as a reminder of Allah's authority and our utter dependence upon Him.",وربك الغني ذو الرحمة إن يشأ يذهبكم ويستخلف من بعدكم ما يشاء كما أنشأكم من ذرية قوم آخرين

But the portion of their 'partners' does not reach Allah, while the portion of Allah goes to their 'partners.' Evil is the way they judge.","This verse condemns the pagan Arabs' practice of assigning a portion of their crops and cattle to Allah, while allocating another portion to their idols or 'partners' associated with Allah. It criticizes their false belief that what they dedicated to their idols would not reach Allah, but what they dedicated to Allah would somehow reach their idols as well. The Qur'an denounces this as an evil judgement on their part, stemming from their ignorance and polytheistic beliefs.",وجعلوا لله مما ذرأ من الحرث والأنعام نصيبا فقالوا هذا لله بزعمهم وهذا لشركائنا فما كان لشركائهم فلا يصل إلى الله وما كان لله فهو يصل إلى شركائهم ساء ما يحكمون

They falsely claimed that some were forbidden except for those they permitted. They also prohibited the use of certain animals' backs and neglected to mention Allah's name over some animals when slaughtering them. All of these were baseless fabrications against Allah, for which they will be punished.",وقالوا هذه أنعام وحرث حجر لا يطعمها إلا من نشاء بزعمهم وأنعام حرمت ظهورها وأنعام لا يذكرون اسم الله عليها افتراء عليه سيجزيهم بما كانوا يفترون

He will punish them for their attribution. Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.","This verse criticizes the pagan Arabs' superstitious beliefs and customs regarding livestock. They falsely claimed that the milk and offspring of certain animals were exclusively for men, prohibiting women from partaking. However, if the newborn was stillborn, both men and women could share it. Allah condemns such arbitrary discrimination and declares that He will hold them accountable for their unjust attributions. The verse highlights Allah's wisdom in legislating justice and His knowledge of their misguided practices.",وقالوا ما في بطون هذه الأنعام خالصة لذكورنا ومحرم على أزواجنا وإن يكن ميتة فهم فيه شركاء سيجزيهم وصفهم إنه حكيم عليم

Eat of its fruit when it yields, and pay its due on the day of its harvest, and do not be excessive. He does not love the excessive.","This verse highlights Allah's power in creating a variety of gardens, crops, and fruits with different tastes, shapes, and appearances. It encourages us to appreciate and consume the fruits when they are ripe, while paying the obligatory charity on the harvest day. However, it warns against wastefulness and extravagance, as Allah does not love those who exceed the proper limits.",وهو الذي أنشأ جنات معروشات وغير معروشات والنخل والزرع مختلفا أكله والزيتون والرمان متشابها وغير متشابه كلوا من ثمره إذا أثمر وآتوا حقه يوم حصاده ولا تسرفوا إنه لا يحب المسرفين

Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.'","This verse refutes the pagan Arabs' superstitious beliefs about the lawfulness or unlawfulness of certain animals based on their gender. Allah challenges them to provide evidence for such beliefs, which were mere fabrications against Allah's teachings without any knowledge or divine sanction. The verse establishes that Allah alone has the authority to legislate what is permissible or prohibited, and those who invent lies against Allah's laws are unjust and misguided.",ومن الإبل اثنين ومن البقر اثنين قل آلذكرين حرم أم الأنثيين أما اشتملت عليه أرحام الأنثيين أم كنتم شهداء إذ وصاكم الله بهذا فمن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا ليضل الناس بغير علم إن الله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين

Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion. And indeed, We are truthful.","Allah prohibited for the Jews the consumption of animals with undivided hoofs, such as camels and donkeys, as well as the fat of cattle and sheep, except for the fat attached to their backs, intestines, or bones. This was a punishment for their disobedience and transgression against Allah's commands. Allah affirms that He is truthful in His words and promises.",وعلى الذين هادوا حرمنا كل ذي ظفر ومن البقر والغنم حرمنا عليهم شحومهما إلا ما حملت ظهورهما أو الحوايا أو ما اختلط بعظم ذلك جزيناهم ببغيهم وإنا لصادقون
935,6,147,"But if they deny you, then say, 'Your Lord is the Lord of vast mercy, but His wrath cannot be averted from the people who are delinquent.'","This verse emphasizes that although Allah is Extremely Merciful, His punishment will inevitably befall those who persist in denial and disobedience. It serves as a warning that one should not be deluded by Allah's mercy into thinking that they can escape accountability for their actions. Allah's mercy is vast, but it does not negate His justice or the consequences for those who knowingly reject the truth.",فإن كذبوك فقل ربكم ذو رحمة واسعة ولا يرد بأسه عن القوم المجرمين
936,6,148,"Those who associate partners with Allah will say, 'If Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners, nor would our forefathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.' Likewise did those before them deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, 'Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow nothing but assumptions, and you do nothing but conjecture.'","This verse refutes the claim of the polytheists that they associated partners with Allah because Allah willed it. The interpretation is that they are making excuses for their polytheism and trying to justify their actions by attributing them to Allah's will. However, the Qur'an rejects this argument and states that they have no knowledge or evidence to support their claims, and that they are merely following assumptions and conjectures.",سيقول الذين أشركوا لو شاء الله ما أشركنا ولا آباؤنا ولا حرمنا من شيء كذلك كذب الذين من قبلهم حتى ذاقوا بأسنا قل هل عندكم من علم فتخرجوه لنا إن تتبعون إلا الظن وإن أنتم إلا تخرصون
937,6,149,"Say, 'To Allah belongs the perfect argument. Had He willed, He could have guided you all.'","This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and power. The ""perfect argument"" refers to Allah's undeniable proofs and evidence of His existence and authority. If Allah had willed, He could have guided all of humanity to the truth, but He has given people free will to choose whether to accept guidance or not. The verse highlights Allah's ability to guide, while also respecting human free choice.",قل فلله الحجة البالغة فلو شاء لهداكم أجمعين
938,6,150,"Say, ""Bring your witnesses who will testify that Allah has forbidden this. And if they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our verses, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and they equate others with their Lord.""","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad to challenge the idolaters who forbid certain foods, claiming that Allah has prohibited them. It tells him to ask them for evidence from credible witnesses to support their claim. If they provide such witnesses, the Prophet is instructed not to accept their testimony because it contradicts the teachings of Allah. The verse also warns against following the desires of those who reject Allah's revelations, disbelieve in the Hereafter, and associate partners with Allah.",قل هلم شهداءكم الذين يشهدون أن الله حرم هذا فإن شهدوا فلا تشهد معهم ولا تتبع أهواء الذين كذبوا بآياتنا والذين لا يؤمنون بالآخرة وهم بربهم يعدلون
939,6,151,"Say, ""Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide sustenance for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.""","This verse commands the believers to worship Allah alone and associate no partners with Him. It also enjoins kindness and good treatment towards parents. It prohibits killing children out of poverty or fear of poverty, as Allah is the Provider for all. It forbids all immoral and shameful deeds, whether apparent or hidden. Additionally, it prohibits taking a life except through legal and justified means prescribed by Allah. These commandments are given so that people may use their reason and intellect to obey Allah's instructions.",قل تعالوا أتل ما حرم ربكم عليكم ألا تشركوا به شيئا وبالوالدين إحسانا ولا تقتلوا أولادكم من إملاق نحن نرزقكم وإياهم ولا تقربوا الفواحش ما ظهر منها وما بطن ولا تقتلوا النفس التي حرم الله إلا بالحق ذلكم وصاكم به لعلكم تعقلون
940,6,152,"And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice. We do not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak, then be just, even if [it concerns] a near relative. And the covenant of Allah fulfill. That has He instructed you that you may remember.","This verse provides guidance on dealing with orphans' wealth, being just in measurements, not burdening anyone beyond their capacity, speaking truthfully even with relatives, and fulfilling one's covenants with Allah. It emphasizes the importance of upholding justice, fairness, and fulfilling one's obligations towards others, especially the vulnerable like orphans, and towards Allah.",ولا تقربوا مال اليتيم إلا بالتي هي أحسن حتى يبلغ أشده وأوفوا الكيل والميزان بالقسط لا نكلف نفسا إلا وسعها وإذا قلتم فاعدلوا ولو كان ذا قربى وبعهد الله أوفوا ذلكم وصاكم به لعلكم تذكرون
941,6,153,"And this is My straight path, so follow it, and do not follow the other paths, for they will separate you from His path. That is what He has enjoined upon you, so that you may attain righteousness.","This verse emphasizes the importance of adhering to the straight path prescribed by Allah and avoiding deviation from it. The ""straight path"" refers to the teachings of Islam and the guidance provided by the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad. Allah commands believers to follow this path and not be misled by other paths that may lead them astray. The verse warns that following other paths will separate them from Allah's path and cause division. Ultimately, Allah has given these commandments to guide people towards righteousness and attaining His pleasure.",وأن هذا صراطي مستقيما فاتبعوه ولا تتبعوا السبل فتفرق بكم عن سبيله ذلكم وصاكم به لعلكم تتقون
942,6,154,"Then We gave Moses the Book, completing [Our favor] upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things - a guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting with their Lord they would believe.","This verse indicates that Allah bestowed the Torah upon Prophet Moses as a complete favor and blessing upon him for his righteousness. The Torah served as a comprehensive and detailed explanation of all religious matters, providing guidance and mercy. The purpose was to inspire belief in the people regarding their ultimate meeting with Allah on the Day of Judgment.",ثم آتينا موسى الكتاب تماما على الذي أحسن وتفصيلا لكل شيء وهدى ورحمة لعلهم بلقاء ربهم يؤمنون
943,6,155,"And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed and confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities and those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are constant in guarding their prayers.","The Qur'an is a blessed book revealed by Allah as a guide and mercy for humanity. It confirms the truth of previous scriptures and serves as a warning, particularly to the people of Makkah and its surrounding areas. Those who believe in the Hereafter and the accountability of their deeds will have faith in the Qur'an and will be diligent in performing their prayers.",وهذا كتاب أنزلناه مبارك فاتبعوه واتقوا لعلكم ترحمون
944,6,156,"That you say, 'The Book was sent down only upon two groups before us, and we were indeed unaware of their study,'","This verse refers to the disbelievers' claim that the revelation was only sent down to two groups before them, the Jews and the Christians, and that they were unaware of studying or learning from their scriptures. The interpretation is that the disbelievers were making excuses for their rejection of the Qur'an by claiming ignorance of the previous revelations and attempting to undermine the universality of Allah's message.",أن تقولوا إنما أنزل الكتاب على طائفتين من قبلنا وإن كنا عن دراستهم لغافلين
945,6,157,"Or you say, 'If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they.' So there has come to you a clear evidence from your Lord, and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for what they used to turn away.",هذا تحذير من الله تعالى للمشركين الذين رفضوا الإيمان بالقرآن الكريم، حيث يقول لهم إن كنتم تقولون لو أنزل علينا كتاب لاتبعناه وكنا أهدى من المسلمين، فقد جاءكم بينة واضحة من ربكم وهي القرآن الكريم، وهدى ورحمة، فمن أظلم ممن كذب بآيات الله وأعرض عنها؟ سنجازي هؤلاء الذين يصدفون عن آياتنا ويعرضون عنها بأشد العذاب في الآخرة، جزاء لهم على إعراضهم وتكذيبهم.,أو تقولوا لو أنا أنزل علينا الكتاب لكنا أهدى منهم فقد جاءكم بينة من ربكم وهدى ورحمة فمن أظلم ممن كذب بآيات الله وصدف عنها سنجزي الذين يصدفون عن آياتنا سوء العذاب بما كانوا يصدفون
946,6,158,"Do they await but that the angels should come to them, or your Lord should come, or that there come some of the signs of your Lord? The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good. Say: 'Wait! We too are waiting.'","This verse warns the disbelievers against awaiting tangible evidence of God's existence or the Day of Judgment before embracing faith. It states that on the Day when some of God's signs become manifest, belief will be of no avail to those who had rejected faith earlier, unless they had done some good deeds stemming from faith. The believers are instructed to be patient and persevere, as the disbelievers will face the consequences of their denial.",هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة أو يأتي ربك أو يأتي بعض آيات ربك يوم يأتي بعض آيات ربك لا ينفع نفسا إيمانها لم تكن آمنت من قبل أو كسبت في إيمانها خيرا قل انتظروا إنا منتظرون
947,6,159,"Indeed, those who divided their religion and became sects - you, [O Muhammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allah; then He will inform them about what they used to do.","This verse condemns the act of dividing religion into sects and groups based on personal desires and whims, rather than following the true teachings revealed by Allah. It absolves the Prophet Muhammad from any association with those who engage in such divisive practices. Their ultimate judgment lies with Allah, who will hold them accountable for their actions and inform them of the consequences.",إن الذين فرقوا دينهم وكانوا شيعا لست منهم في شيء إنما أمرهم إلى الله ثم ينبئهم بما كانوا يفعلون
948,6,160,"Whoever brings a good deed will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and whoever brings an ill deed will not be recompensed but the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.","This verse highlights the immense reward for good deeds and the justice in punishment for evil deeds. It emphasizes that Allah multiplies the reward for good deeds tenfold, while evil deeds are recompensed equally without any injustice or wrongdoing. This shows Allah's vast mercy and encouragement for righteous actions, as well as His perfect justice in dealing with sins.",من جاء بالحسنة فله عشر أمثالها ومن جاء بالسيئة فلا يجزى إلا مثلها وهم لا يظلمون
949,6,161,"Say, 'Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path - a correct religion, the way of Abraham, inclining toward truth. And he was not among those who associated others with Allah.'","This verse emphasizes the guidance and straight path that Allah has bestowed upon the Prophet Muhammad and his followers. It highlights the pure monotheistic faith of Islam, which is described as the ""correct religion"" and the ""way of Abraham."" Abraham (peace be upon him) is mentioned as a role model for his unwavering devotion to the Oneness of God and rejection of polytheism or associating partners with Allah. The verse affirms that true guidance comes from Allah alone, leading to a straight and unwavering path of truth and submission to the One God.",قل إنني هداني ربي إلى صراط مستقيم دينا قيما ملة إبراهيم حنيفا وما كان من المشركين
950,6,162,"Say, 'Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.'","This verse emphasizes complete devotion and submission to Allah alone. All acts of worship, rituals, life, and death should be dedicated solely to Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all the worlds and creations. It signifies that a believer's entire existence revolves around Allah and should be devoted to His worship and obedience.",قل إن صلاتي ونسكي ومحياي ومماتي لله رب العالمين
951,6,163,"He has no partner, and I am commanded this, and I am the first of those who submit.","This verse affirms the Oneness of Allah and that He has no partner or associate in His Lordship and worship. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) declares that he has been commanded to worship Allah alone without any partners, and that he is the first among the Muslims who submit to this command of pure monotheism.",لا شريك له وبذلك أمرت وأنا أول المسلمين
952,6,164,"Say, ""Shall I seek a lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things? And no soul earns [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another.

It affirms that everyone is accountable for their own deeds and will not bear the burden of others' sins.

Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.","This verse indicates that Allah has given human beings the role of successors or vicegerents on earth, with some people being elevated above others in rank and status. This difference in ranks and degrees is a trial from Allah to test how people utilize the blessings and favors He has bestowed upon them. It serves as a reminder that while Allah is swift in punishing those who transgress, He is also Forgiving and Merciful towards those who repent and seek His forgiveness.",وهو الذي جعلكم خلائف الأرض ورفع بعضكم فوق بعض درجات ليبلوكم في ما آتاكم إن ربك سريع العقاب وإنه لغفور رحيم
954,7,1,The night,"This verse refers to the night as a symbol of tranquility, peace, and a time for reflection and contemplation.

It emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah alone and warns against associating partners or allies with Him. The phrase ""Little do you remember"" serves as a reminder of humanity's forgetfulness and negligence in heeding this crucial command.",اتبعوا ما أنزل إليكم من ربكم ولا تتبعوا من دونه أولياء قليلا ما تذكرون
957,7,4,"And how many a town have We destroyed, and Our punishment came upon it at night or while they were taking a midday nap?","This verse serves as a warning and reminder of Allah's ability to swiftly punish nations that persist in disbelief and disobedience. It highlights that Allah's punishment can come at any time, whether during the night when people are asleep or in the day when they are resting. The destruction of such towns is a consequence of their rejection of faith and moral corruption. The verse emphasizes the importance of heeding divine guidance and maintaining righteousness to avoid a similar fate.",وكم من قرية أهلكناها فجاءها بأسنا بياتا أو هم قائلون
958,7,5,"So when Our punishment came to them, their cry was only that they said: 'Indeed, we have been wrongdoers.'","The interpretation is that when the punishment and torment of Allah came upon the disbelievers who rejected the message of the Prophets, they had no excuse or plea except to admit that they had wronged themselves by disbelieving and committing sins. Their confession of being wrongdoers came too late to be of any benefit to them.",فما كان دعواهم إذ جاءهم بأسنا إلا أن قالوا إنا كنا ظالمين
959,7,6,"Then We will surely question those to whom (the Message) was sent, and We will surely question the Messengers.","This verse indicates that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will hold accountable both those who received the divine message through the Messengers, as well as the Messengers themselves. The people will be questioned about how they responded to the Message, and the Messengers will be questioned about how they conveyed it. This highlights the gravity of the trust placed upon the Messengers and the responsibility of the recipients to heed the Message. No one will be excused or overlooked on that Day.",فلنسألن الذين أرسل إليهم ولنسألن المرسلين
960,7,7,"So We will narrate to them with knowledge, and We were not absent.","Allah is stating that He will recount the stories and events of the past nations to the Prophet Muhammad and the believers with full knowledge and accuracy, as He was not absent or unaware of what transpired with those nations.

961,7,8,And the weighing [of deeds] that Day will be the truth. So those whose scales are heavy - it is they who are the successful.,"On the Day of Judgment, the weighing of people's deeds will be done with complete justice and fairness. Those whose good deeds outweigh their bad deeds will be the truly successful ones, who will attain salvation and eternal bliss in Paradise.",والوزن يومئذ الحق فمن ثقلت موازينه فأولئك هم المفلحون
962,7,9,And those whose scales are light - they are the ones who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward Our verses.,"This verse warns those whose good deeds are outweighed by their evil deeds on the Day of Judgment. They will have failed to achieve salvation and will suffer the consequences of rejecting God's revelations and denying the truth. It emphasizes the importance of faith, righteous conduct, and heeding divine guidance to avoid spiritual and eternal loss.",ومن خفت موازينه فأولئك الذين خسروا أنفسهم بما كانوا بآياتنا يظلمون
963,7,10,And We have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein ways of livelihood. Little are you grateful.,"Allah reminds us of His great blessing upon humanity by granting us the ability to live on earth and providing us with the means of sustenance. However, most people fail to appreciate this immense favor and show little gratitude towards their Lord.",ولقد مكناكم في الأرض وجعلنا لكم فيها معايش قليلا ما تشكرون
964,7,11,"And We have certainly created you, [O Mankind], and given you [human] form. Then We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam,' so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was not of those who prostrated.","This verse highlights the unique status of human beings as Allah's honored creation. Allah first created humankind and fashioned them in the best form. Then, as a test of obedience, Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, which they all did except Iblees (Satan), who arrogantly refused. This event underscores the elevated rank of humans over angels and the importance of submitting to Allah's commands without arrogance.",ولقد خلقناكم ثم صورناكم ثم قلنا للملائكة اسجدوا لآدم فسجدوا إلا إبليس لم يكن من الساجدين
965,7,12,He said: 'What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?' He said: 'I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.',"This verse refers to the dialogue between Allah and Iblis (Satan) after Iblis disobeyed Allah's command to prostrate before Adam. Iblis displayed arrogance and considered himself superior to Adam because he was created from fire while Adam was created from clay. This shows Iblis's pride and disobedience, which led to his expulsion from Paradise.",قال ما منعك ألا تسجد إذ أمرتك قال أنا خير منه خلقتني من نار وخلقته من طين

967,7,14,"He will say, ""Reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.""","This verse refers to the request that the disbelievers will make on the Day of Judgment, asking for a delay or postponement until the Day of Resurrection. It suggests their denial of the Resurrection and their desire to avoid facing the consequences of their disbelief. However, their request will be denied, as the Day of Resurrection is an inevitable reality that they will have to face.",قال أنظرني إلى يوم يبعثون
968,7,15,It is said that you are one of the theorists,"This verse suggests that the person being addressed is considered to be among those who engage in speculation or theorizing, implying that their ideas or views are based on theoretical reasoning rather than concrete evidence or practical experience.",قال إنك من المنظرين

Shaytan blamed Allah for his misguidance and vowed to mislead humanity by sitting on the Straight Path, which is the path of truth, guidance, and righteousness prescribed by Allah. Shaytan's aim is to lead people astray from this path through deception and temptation.",قال فبما أغويتني لأقعدن لهم صراطك المستقيم
970,7,17,"Then We will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful.","This verse implies that disbelievers will be surrounded by Allah's punishment and torment from all sides on the Day of Judgment.

971,7,18,"He (Allah) said: 'Get out from this (Paradise) disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then I will fill Hell with you all.'",This verse indicates that Shaytan (Satan) was expelled from Paradise due to his arrogance and disobedience to Allah. Those who follow his path and obey him will also be condemned to Hell.

Dwell you and your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.","This verse addresses Adam and his wife, granting them permission to reside in Paradise and partake of its provisions freely, except for a single tree which they are forbidden from approaching. The prohibition against this tree serves as a test of their obedience to God's command. Disobeying this command would render them among the wrongdoers who transgress against divine injunctions.",ويا آدم اسكن أنت وزوجك الجنة فكلا من حيث شئتما ولا تقربا هذه الشجرة فتكونا من الظالمين
973,7,20,"Then Satan whispered to them, to uncover what was hidden from them of their private parts, and he said, 'Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree lest you become angels or become of the immortals.'","Satan tempted Adam and Eve to disobey God's command by suggesting that God had forbidden them from eating the fruit of the tree out of jealousy, fearing that they would become angels or immortal beings like Him. This was a deception aimed at sowing doubts about God's wisdom and motives.",فوسوس لهما الشيطان ليبدي لهما ما ووري عنهما من سوآتهما وقال ما نهاكما ربكما عن هذه الشجرة إلا أن تكونا ملكين أو تكونا من الخالدين

Allah then called out to them, reminding them that He had warned them against the tree and that Satan was their sworn enemy, seeking to misguide them.",فدلاهما بغرور فلما ذاقا الشجرة بدت لهما سوآتهما وطفقا يخصفان عليهما من ورق الجنة وناداهما ربهما ألم أنهكما عن تلكما الشجرة وأقل لكما إن الشيطان لكما عدو مبين

979,7,26,"O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment. But the clothing of righteousness - that is best. That is from the signs of Allah that perhaps they will remember.","This verse teaches that while physical clothing covers the body, the true ""clothing"" that is most valuable is righteousness and piety. It reminds us that outward adornment is temporary, but inward virtue through consciousness of Allah is far more important and lasting. The reference to Allah's ""signs"" suggests that our clothing and sense of modesty should remind us of our Creator and inspire us to live righteously.",يا بني آدم قد أنزلنا عليكم لباسا يواري سوآتكم وريشا ولباس التقوى ذلك خير ذلك من آيات الله لعلهم يذكرون

Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?'","This verse condemns the practice of blindly following traditions and cultural norms that go against the teachings of Islam. It criticizes those who justify their immoral actions by claiming that their ancestors did the same and that it is sanctioned by Allah. The verse makes it clear that Allah does not command indecency or immorality, and that attributing such commands to Him without knowledge is a grave sin.",وإذا فعلوا فاحشة قالوا وجدنا عليها آباءنا والله أمرنا بها قل إن الله لا يأمر بالفحشاء أتقولون على الله ما لا تعلمون

The latter group took the devils (shayatin) as their allies and protectors instead of Allah, falsely believing that they were rightly guided. This highlights the grave consequence of associating partners with Allah and following the misguiding whispers of the shayatin, which leads to misguidance and eternal loss.",فريقا هدى وفريقا حق عليهم الضلالة إنهم اتخذوا الشياطين أولياء من دون الله ويحسبون أنهم مهتدون

Take your adornment at every masjid, and eat and drink, but waste not by excess, indeed He likes not the wasters.","This verse teaches moderation and balance in our lives. We are encouraged to adorn ourselves and enjoy the lawful provisions of Allah, but we must avoid extravagance and wasteful excess.

Those who reject faith out of arrogance and persist in disbelief will be the dwellers of Hellfire, wherein they will abide forever as a punishment for their arrogance and denial.",والذين كذبوا بآياتنا واستكبروا عنها أولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون
990,7,37,"So who does more wrong than he who forges a lie against Allah, or denies His signs? Those - their share of the Book will reach them.

It uses a metaphor, saying that it is as impossible for them to enter Paradise as it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. This metaphor emphasizes the extreme difficulty, or rather impossibility, of arrogant disbelievers attaining salvation. The verse implies that humility, faith, and obedience to God's commandments are essential for attaining His mercy and entrance into Paradise.",إن الذين كذبوا بآياتنا واستكبروا عنها لا تفتح لهم أبواب السماء ولا يدخلون الجنة حتى يلج الجمل في سم الخياط وكذلك نجزي المجرمين

It describes their abode in Hell as a ""bed"" and coverings of fire over them, indicating intense torment and suffering with no escape. This is the ultimate recompense for those who persist in wrongdoing and reject faith, highlighting the grave consequences of their actions.",لهم من جهنم مهاد ومن فوقهم غواش وكذلك نجزي الظالمين
995,7,42,And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will not tax any soul beyond its capacity. Those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.,"The interpretation of this verse is that Allah will not burden a person beyond their ability and capacity. Those who have faith and perform good deeds will be rewarded with Paradise, where they will dwell forever. It emphasizes Allah's justice and mercy, as He does not impose obligations that are impossible for people to fulfill. The righteous believers will be rewarded with an eternal abode in Paradise as a result of their faith and good actions.",والذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات لا نكلف نفسا إلا وسعها أولئك أصحاب الجنة هم فيها خالدون

They have certainly lost themselves, and lost from them is whatever they used to invent.","This verse warns those who deny the truth that they will realize it on the Day of Judgment, but it will be too late. They will wish for a second chance or intercessors to help them, but their pleas will be in vain. They have ruined their own souls by rejecting the truth and inventing falsehoods.

Thus do We diversify the signs for a people who are grateful.","""This verse draws an analogy between the land and the human soul. The fertile land that receives rain and nourishment produces abundant vegetation, just as the pure soul that receives the guidance of Allah flourishes with faith and good deeds. Conversely, the barren land that lacks nourishment yields little or no vegetation, just as the corrupt soul deprived of faith yields only misery and hardship.

Will you not then be afraid (of Him)?'","The interpretation is that Allah sent the Prophet Hud to the 'Aad people, who were known for their physical strength and prosperity, but had deviated from the worship of the One True God. Hud called them to worship Allah alone, as there is no deity worthy of worship except Him.

1128,7,175,"And recite to them the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he detached himself from them; so Shaytan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray.","This verse refers to a person who was given knowledge and guidance from Allah, but he turned away from it and followed the temptations of Satan. The interpretation is a warning against arrogance, heedlessness, and succumbing to one's desires, which can lead a person astray from the straight path, even after being guided.",واتل عليهم نبأ الذي آتيناه آياتنا فانسلخ منها فأتبعه الشيطان فكان من الغاوين
1129,7,176,"And if We willed, We could have raised him by it, but he clung to the earth and followed his desires. So his example is like the example of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it pants. That is the example of those who denied Our signs. So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.","This verse is a metaphor comparing those who reject Allah's signs and follow their own desires to a dog. Just as a dog pants whether you chase it away or leave it alone, the disbelievers remain attached to worldly desires and pleasures, unable to elevate themselves spiritually. The story or parable is meant to make them reflect and reconsider their ways.",ولو شئنا لرفعناه بها ولكنه أخلد إلى الأرض واتبع هواه فمثله كمثل الكلب إن تحمل عليه يلهث أو تتركه يلهث ذلك مثل القوم الذين كذبوا بآياتنا فاقصص القصص لعلهم يتفكرون
1130,7,177,"Evil is the example of the people who denied Our signs, and used to wrong themselves.","This verse condemns those who reject Allah's signs and evidence, and persist in wronging themselves by depriving themselves of guidance and truth. Their example is described as ""evil"", indicating the grave consequences of their disbelief and injustice towards their own souls.",ساء مثلا القوم الذين كذبوا بآياتنا وأنفسهم كانوا يظلمون
1131,7,178,"Whomever Allah guides, he is the rightly guided; and whomever He sends astray - it is they who are the losers.","This verse emphasizes that true guidance comes from Allah alone. Those whom Allah guides are truly guided, while those whom He allows to go astray have incurred a great loss, for they have missed the purpose of their existence and the path to eternal bliss.",من يهد الله فهو المهتدي ومن يضلل فأولئك هم الخاسرون
1132,7,179,"And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like cattle; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse is a stern warning to those who willfully reject faith and follow their desires blindly. It compares them to cattle, or even worse, as they possess the faculties of reason and understanding but fail to use them properly. Their hearts are unable to comprehend the truth, their eyes cannot perceive the signs of God, and their ears are deaf to the divine guidance. They are the heedless ones, oblivious to the consequences of their actions and the impending punishment in the Hereafter.",ولقد ذرأنا لجهنم كثيرا من الجن والإنس لهم قلوب لا يفقهون بها ولهم أعين لا يبصرون بها ولهم آذان لا يسمعون بها أولئك كالأنعام بل هم أضل أولئك هم الغافلون
1133,7,180,"And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation concerning His names. They will be recompensed for what they have been doing.","This verse emphasizes the importance of using Allah's beautiful names when calling upon Him and avoiding those who distort or misuse His names. It teaches us to invoke Allah using His perfect attributes and to stay away from those who deviate from the proper understanding and usage of His names, as they will be held accountable for their actions.",ولله الأسماء الحسنى فادعوه بها وذروا الذين يلحدون في أسمائه سيجزون ما كانوا يعملون
1134,7,181,"And among those We have created, there is a community which guides by truth and thereby maintains justice.","This verse refers to the existence of a righteous community among humanity that upholds truth and justice. It implies that Allah has created a group of people who are guided by the truth revealed in His message, and they use this guidance to establish fairness and equity in their dealings and judgments.",وممن خلقنا أمة يهدون بالحق وبه يعدلون
1135,7,182,"And those who deny Our signs, We will gradually lead them to destruction in ways they do not know.","This verse warns those who reject Allah's revelations and signs that they will be gradually led to their own destruction without realizing it. Their denial and disbelief will lead them down a path of misguidance and ruin, step by step, in a way that they are unaware of until it is too late. It implies that their punishment will come in an insidious and subtle manner, not all at once, as a result of their stubborn rejection of the truth.",والذين كذبوا بآياتنا سنستدرجهم من حيث لا يعلمون
1136,7,183,"But grant thou me respite, I will guide them aright by a gradual process.","Allah is telling the Shaytan (Satan) to wait and not rush in misleading people, for Allah's plan is firm and steady. He will allow Shaytan to gradually misguide those who choose to follow him, but in the end, Allah's guidance will prevail over Shaytan's deception.",وأملي لهم إن كيدي متين
1137,7,184,Have they not pondered over their Companion? He is not but a clear warner.,"This verse invites people to reflect upon the character and message of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. It emphasizes that he is a clear and evident warner sent by Allah to guide humanity towards the truth and righteousness. The verse prompts people to contemplate the noble qualities and truthfulness of the Prophet, rather than dismissing him or doubting his message.",أولم يتفكروا ما بصاحبهم من جنة إن هو إلا نذير مبين
1138,7,185,"Have they not looked at the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what Allah has created of things, and that it may be that their own term has drawn near? So in what statement after this will they believe?","This verse invites people to reflect on the signs of Allah's power and greatness in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures therein. It suggests that this reflection should lead them to realize that the Hour of Judgment may be near, and they should prepare for it by believing in Allah's revelations and the message of the Prophet. The verse implies that if they do not believe in the Qur'an, which is a clear and convincing message, then what other statement will they believe in?",أولم ينظروا في ملكوت السماوات والأرض وما خلق الله من شيء وأن عسى أن يكون قد اقترب أجلهم فبأي حديث بعده يؤمنون
1139,7,186,"Whomever Allah lets go astray, there is no guide for him; and He leaves them wandering blindly in their insolence.","This verse indicates that those whom Allah has willed to be misguided, there is none who can guide them to the right path. It also states that Allah leaves such people to continue wandering in their arrogance and rebellion, unable to find the truth due to their own obstinacy and blindness of heart.",من يضلل الله فلا هادي له ويذرهم في طغيانهم يعمهون
1140,7,187,"They ask you about the Hour, when will be its appointed time? Say: ""Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None can reveal its time but He. It lays heavily upon the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except unexpectedly."" They ask you as if you were eager in inquiring about it. Say: ""Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most of the people do not know.""","This verse emphasizes that the knowledge of when the Hour (Day of Resurrection) will occur is known only to Allah. No one else can reveal its appointed time. The Hour is a tremendously significant event that will heavily impact the heavens and the earth. It will come suddenly and unexpectedly. The people question the Prophet about the Hour as if he has detailed knowledge of it, but he responds that its knowledge rests only with Allah, and most people do not comprehend this reality.",يسألونك عن الساعة أيان مرساها قل إنما علمها عند ربي لا يجليها لوقتها إلا هو ثقلت في السماوات والأرض لا تأتيكم إلا بغتة يسألونك كأنك حفي عنها قل إنما علمها عند الله ولكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون
1141,7,188,"Say, 'I have no power to benefit or harm myself, except as Allah wills. If I had known the unseen, I would have enriched myself with all the good, and no harm would have touched me. I am only a warner and a bearer of good tidings for a people who believe.'","This verse emphasizes the complete powerlessness of the Prophet Muhammad and all human beings before the will of Allah. It clarifies that no one can benefit themselves or prevent harm except by Allah's permission. If the Prophet had knowledge of the unseen, he would have sought all good for himself and avoided harm, but he is merely a messenger sent to warn and give glad tidings to the believers.",قل لا أملك لنفسي نفعا ولا ضرا إلا ما شاء الله ولو كنت أعلم الغيب لاستكثرت من الخير وما مسني السوء إن أنا إلا نذير وبشير لقوم يؤمنون
1142,7,189,"It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in tranquillity with her; and when he covered her, she carried a light burden and passed some time with it, but when she grew heavy, they both called upon Allah, their Lord: If You give us a righteous child, we shall indeed be among the grateful.","Allah created all human beings from a single soul, Adam, and created his wife, Eve, from him so that they may find peace and tranquility with each other. When Adam had relations with Eve, she became pregnant with a light burden. As her pregnancy progressed and the burden became heavier, they prayed to Allah to grant them a righteous child, promising to be among the grateful if their supplication was answered.",هو الذي خلقكم من نفس واحدة وجعل منها زوجها ليسكن إليها فلما تغشاها حملت حملا خفيفا فمرت به فلما أثقلت دعوا الله ربهما لئن آتيتنا صالحا لنكونن من الشاكرين
1143,7,190,"But when He gave them a good [child], they ascribed partners to Him concerning that which He had given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate with Him.","The interpretation is that when Allah blessed them with a righteous child, instead of being grateful to Allah alone, they associated partners with Him by attributing the blessing to others besides Allah. This is a condemnation of shirk (associating partners with Allah) and ingratitude for Allah's favors.",فلما آتاهما صالحا جعلا له شركاء فيما آتاهما فتعالى الله عما يشركون
1144,7,191,"Do they associate with Him those that do not create anything, while they are themselves created?","This verse questions the absurdity of associating partners with Allah in worship, when those partners are themselves created beings incapable of creating anything. It highlights the illogical nature of idolatry and polytheism, as the idols or false deities have no power to create or benefit their worshippers in any way. The verse emphasizes that only Allah, the Creator of all things, is worthy of worship and should not be associated with any created beings or objects.",أيشركون ما لا يخلق شيئا وهم يخلقون
1145,7,192,"And they cannot aid them, nor can they aid themselves.","This verse highlights the utter helplessness of the false deities that people worship besides Allah. It emphasizes that these idols or false gods have no power to assist their worshippers or even themselves. They are completely incapable of providing any support or protection, rendering their worship futile and misguided.",ولا يستطيعون لهم نصرا ولا أنفسهم ينصرون
1146,7,193,"And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you whether you invite them or you remain silent.","This verse indicates that the disbelievers are stubborn and unwilling to accept the truth, no matter how much you call them to it. Their rejection of guidance is not due to any fault in the way it is presented, but rather due to their own obstinacy and closed-mindedness. Therefore, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is told not to be disheartened if they do not respond positively to his call, as their reaction is not a reflection on him or his efforts.",وإن تدعوهم إلى الهدى لا يتبعوكم سواء عليكم أدعوتموهم أم أنتم صامتون
1147,7,194,"Indeed, those you call upon besides Allah are servants like you. So call upon them and let them respond to you, if you should be truthful.","This verse emphasizes the futility of worshipping anything other than Allah. It states that those beings that the idolaters invoke besides Allah are merely His servants, just like humans. They have no power to respond to prayers or supplications. If the idolaters truly believe these entities are worthy of worship, they should call upon them, and see if they can answer their calls. This verse highlights the absurdity of idol worship and affirms that only Allah is worthy of being supplicated and worshipped.",إن الذين تدعون من دون الله عباد أمثالكم فادعوهم فليستجيبوا لكم إن كنتم صادقين
1148,7,195,"Have they feet to walk with? Or have they hands to strike with? Or have they eyes to see with? Or have they ears to hear with? Say, 'Call your partners, then plot against me and give me no respite.'","This verse challenges the polytheists to consider the absurdity of their beliefs in associating partners with Allah. It questions whether these alleged partners possess any faculties or abilities to warrant worship. The rhetorical questions highlight the falsehood of their beliefs, as these inanimate objects lack the basic senses and abilities that Allah has bestowed upon His creation. The verse then commands the Prophet Muhammad to confront the polytheists and challenge them to call upon their false deities, implying that they will be unable to cause him any harm or defend themselves against Allah's power.",ألهم أرجل يمشون بها أم لهم أيد يبطشون بها أم لهم أعين يبصرون بها أم لهم آذان يسمعون بها قل ادعوا شركاءكم ثم كيدون فلا تنظرون
1149,7,196,"Indeed, my ally is Allah, who has sent down the Book, and He protects the righteous.","This verse emphasizes the importance of relying solely on Allah and seeking His protection and guidance. The interpretation is: ""My true ally and supporter is Allah alone, the One who has revealed the Qur'an as a source of guidance. And He is the One who takes care of and protects those who are righteous and obedient to Him.""",إن وليي الله الذي نزل الكتاب وهو يتولى الصالحين
1150,7,197,"And those you call upon besides Him are not able to help you, nor can they help themselves.","This verse emphasizes the futility of worshipping or calling upon any entity besides Allah. Those idols, objects, or beings that people associate as partners with Allah have no power whatsoever to help or benefit them, nor can they even help themselves. This highlights the importance of directing all worship and supplication solely to Allah, the One True God, who alone has the power to grant aid and respond to prayers.",والذين تدعون من دونه لا يستطيعون نصركم ولا أنفسهم ينصرون
1151,7,198,"And if you call them to guidance, they will not hear; and you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.","This verse refers to the stubborn disbelievers who refuse to accept the truth and guidance brought by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Despite his efforts to invite them to the right path, they turn a deaf ear and remain blind to the clear signs and evidence presented to them. Their hearts and minds are closed, and they choose to remain in their state of disbelief, even when the truth is evident before their eyes.",وإن تدعوهم إلى الهدى لا يسمعوا وتراهم ينظرون إليك وهم لا يبصرون
1152,7,199,"Take the pardon and enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant ones.","This verse encourages Muslims to adopt a forgiving and tolerant attitude towards those who wrong them, to promote virtuous conduct, and to disengage from those who persist in ignorance and folly. It emphasizes the importance of responding to provocation with patience and wisdom, rather than retaliation or escalation. The interpretation highlights the virtues of pardoning offences, advocating righteousness, and avoiding futile conflicts with the obstinate and foolish.",خذ العفو وأمر بالعرف وأعرض عن الجاهلين
1153,7,200,"And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.","This verse reminds us that when we are faced with evil thoughts or temptations from Satan, we should immediately seek refuge in Allah, Who is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. By turning to Allah and seeking His protection, we can resist the whispers of Satan and remain steadfast on the path of righteousness. This verse emphasizes the importance of having a strong connection with Allah and relying on Him for guidance and protection against the influence of evil.",وإما ينزغنك من الشيطان نزغ فاستعذ بالله إنه سميع عليم
1154,7,201,"Indeed, those who are conscious of Allah - when an evil suggestion comes to them from Satan, they remember [the truth] and at once they have insight.","This verse indicates that for those who have taqwa (consciousness of Allah and fear of His punishment), when they are afflicted with an evil whisper or suggestion from Satan, they immediately remember Allah and His teachings. This remembrance gives them insight and clarity, allowing them to reject the evil suggestion and remain steadfast on the right path. The verse highlights the importance of taqwa as a shield against Satanic temptations and the power of remembering Allah to dispel such whispers.",إن الذين اتقوا إذا مسهم طائف من الشيطان تذكروا فإذا هم مبصرون
1155,7,202,"And their brothers (the evil ones) plunge them deeper into error, and never leave off (their evil doings).","This verse refers to the misguided people who are led further astray by the evil ones (devils or their companions), who constantly encourage them to persist in their misguidance and sins, never allowing them to reflect or turn back to the right path.",وإخوانهم يمدونهم في الغي ثم لا يقصرون
1156,7,203,"And when they are not brought a sign, they say, 'Why did you not contrive one?' Say, 'I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This [Qur'an] is enlightening vision from your Lord, and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.'","This verse addresses the disbelievers who demanded miracles from the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as proof of his prophethood. The interpretation is that the Prophet ﷺ is instructed to respond by saying that he does not have the ability to produce miracles on his own accord; rather, he can only convey what is revealed to him by Allah. The Qur'an itself is a clear sign and enlightening guidance from Allah, providing direction and mercy for those who have faith.",وإذا لم تأتهم بآية قالوا لولا اجتبيتها قل إنما أتبع ما يوحى إلي من ربي هذا بصائر من ربكم وهدى ورحمة لقوم يؤمنون
1157,7,204,"And when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.","This verse emphasizes the importance of attentively listening to the recitation of the Qur'an with a humble and receptive heart, as doing so can lead to attaining Allah's mercy and blessings. It encourages us to be fully present and focused when the Qur'an is being recited, rather than allowing our minds to wander or be distracted by other matters. By actively listening and reflecting upon the words of Allah, we open ourselves to receiving the guidance, wisdom, and spiritual nourishment contained within the Qur'an, ultimately leading us towards the path of mercy and forgiveness.",وإذا قرئ القرآن فاستمعوا له وأنصتوا لعلكم ترحمون
1158,7,205,"And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and with fear and without being loud in words, in the mornings and the evenings. And do not be among the heedless.","This verse encourages us to remember Allah constantly, in a humble and fearful manner, not loudly or ostentatiously. It specifically mentions remembering Him in the mornings and evenings, which were times when the pre-Islamic Arabs made devotions to their gods. The verse warns us not to be among the heedless who neglect the remembrance of Allah.",واذكر ربك في نفسك تضرعا وخيفة ودون الجهر من القول بالغدو والآصال ولا تكن من الغافلين
1159,7,206,"Indeed, those who are near your Lord are not too arrogant to worship Him, and they glorify Him and prostrate to Him.","This verse emphasizes the humility and devotion of those who are closest to Allah. It indicates that the beings who are closest to Allah, such as the angels, do not consider themselves too exalted or superior to worship and submit to Him. Rather, they constantly glorify and praise Allah, and prostrate before Him in submission and reverence. This serves as a lesson for human beings to adopt a similar attitude of humility and submission towards their Creator.",إن الذين عند ربك لا يستكبرون عن عبادته ويسبحونه وله يسجدون
1160,8,1,"They ask you about the spoils of war. Say, 'The spoils of war are for Allah and the Messenger.' So fear Allah, settle your differences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers.","The interpretation focuses on the distribution of war spoils and the importance of obedience to Allah and the Prophet. It emphasizes that war spoils belong to Allah and the Prophet, who will distribute them justly. Muslims are commanded to fear Allah, resolve conflicts among themselves, and obey Allah and the Prophet if they are true believers.",يسألونك عن الأنفال قل الأنفال لله والرسول فاتقوا الله وأصلحوا ذات بينكم وأطيعوا الله ورسوله إن كنتم مؤمنين
1161,8,2,"The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely.","This verse describes the true qualities of believers. When Allah is remembered, their hearts are filled with awe and reverence. When the verses of the Qur'an are recited to them, it strengthens their faith and increases their conviction. Moreover, they place their complete trust and reliance in Allah alone.",إنما المؤمنون الذين إذا ذكر الله وجلت قلوبهم وإذا تليت عليهم آياته زادتهم إيمانا وعلى ربهم يتوكلون
1162,8,3,Those who establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them,"This verse refers to the believers who faithfully perform their obligatory prayers and spend from the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them in ways that are pleasing to Him. It highlights two important acts of worship: prayer and charity. Prayer is a means of maintaining a connection with Allah, while charity is a way of purifying one's wealth and helping those in need. Together, these acts demonstrate true faith and obedience to Allah's commands.",الذين يقيمون الصلاة ومما رزقناهم ينفقون
1163,8,4,Those are the believers in truth. For them are degrees [of high position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision.,"This verse affirms that those who truly believe in Allah and fulfill the requirements of faith will be granted elevated ranks and high positions in the Hereafter, as well as forgiveness for their sins and an honorable and bountiful provision from Allah.",أولئك هم المؤمنون حقا لهم درجات عند ربهم ومغفرة ورزق كريم
1164,8,5,"As your Lord brought you forth from your home with the truth, and indeed, a party of the believers were unwilling.","This verse refers to the incident when the Prophet Muhammad left Mecca for the migration to Medina. Despite facing opposition from some believers who were reluctant to leave their homes and wealth behind, Allah commanded the Prophet to depart from Mecca ""with the truth"" or in accordance with the divine command and plan.",كما أخرجك ربك من بيتك بالحق وإن فريقا من المؤمنين لكارهون
1165,8,6,"They dispute with you concerning the truth after it was made clear, as if they were being driven to death while they were looking on.","This verse refers to those who stubbornly argue against the truth of Islam, even after it has been made clear to them through evident proofs and signs. Their obstinacy is likened to being driven to their death while fully aware of their fate, yet they persist in their rejection. This emphasizes the severity of their rejection and their unwillingness to accept the truth, despite its clarity.",يجادلونك في الحق بعدما تبين كأنما يساقون إلى الموت وهم ينظرون
1166,8,7,And [recall] when Allah promised you one of the two groups - that it would be yours - and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours. But Allah intended to establish the truth by His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers.,"This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, where the Muslims were faced with two caravan routes - one heavily armed and the other lightly armed. The Muslims desired the lightly armed caravan, thinking it would be an easy target. However, Allah willed that the truth prevail and the disbelievers be defeated, even though they were more powerful militarily. This demonstrates that victory comes from Allah, not from material strength alone.",وإذ يعدكم الله إحدى الطائفتين أنها لكم وتودون أن غير ذات الشوكة تكون لكم ويريد الله أن يحق الحق بكلماته ويقطع دابر الكافرين
1167,8,8,"So that truth may prevail and falsehood may be vanquished, even though the guilty ones dislike it.","This verse emphasizes the ultimate triumph of truth over falsehood, regardless of the opposition or dislike from those who perpetrate evil deeds. It affirms that the truth will be established and falsehood will be defeated, even if those who commit crimes and injustices resist or detest it. The verse highlights the unwavering nature of truth and its eventual victory, while falsehood and wrongdoing will inevitably be exposed and overcome, despite the resistance of the wrongdoers.",ليحق الحق ويبطل الباطل ولو كره المجرمون
1168,8,9,"When you were calling upon your Lord for assistance, and He answered you, 'I will reinforce you with a thousand angels, coming one after another.'","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, where the outnumbered Muslim army sought Allah's help against the Meccan forces. Allah assured them of victory by sending angels to aid them, boosting their morale and granting them a decisive triumph despite being vastly outnumbered. The verse highlights Allah's power to provide unseen support and reassures believers that He answers sincere prayers and aids those who put their trust in Him.",إذ تستغيثون ربكم فاستجاب لكم أني ممدكم بألف من الملائكة مردفين
1169,8,10,"And Allah made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts would be assured thereby. And victory is not but from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","The interpretation of this verse is that Allah sent the dream of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as a glad tiding and reassurance for the believers' hearts. The dream foretold the coming victory, which can only come from Allah alone. He is Mighty in His power and Wise in His decisions and decrees.",وما جعله الله إلا بشرى ولتطمئن به قلوبكم وما النصر إلا من عند الله إن الله عزيز حكيم
1170,8,11,"When He covered you with drowsiness as a security from Him, and sent down upon you water from the sky to purify you thereby, and to remove from you the evil whispers of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts and make your footsteps firm.","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, when Allah sent down a feeling of drowsiness and security upon the believers to calm their nerves before the battle. The ""water from the sky"" is interpreted as either literal rain that purified them physically, or a metaphorical ""rain"" of tranquility that purified their hearts from fear and Satan's whisperings. The verse highlights Allah's support and protection for the believers, strengthening their hearts and making their feet firm against the enemy.",إذ يغشيكم النعاس أمنة منه وينزل عليكم من السماء ماء ليطهركم به ويذهب عنكم رجز الشيطان وليربط على قلوبكم ويثبت به الأقدام
1171,8,12,"When your Lord inspired the angels, 'I am with you, so keep firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, so strike above the necks and strike from them every fingertip.'","This verse is referring to the Battle of Badr, where Allah sent down angels to aid the believers against the disbelievers. The interpretation is that Allah commanded the angels to instill fear in the hearts of the disbelievers, and to strike them with force, either killing them or severing their limbs as punishment for their disbelief and opposition to the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslim community.",إذ يوحي ربك إلى الملائكة أني معكم فثبتوا الذين آمنوا سألقي في قلوب الذين كفروا الرعب فاضربوا فوق الأعناق واضربوا منهم كل بنان
1172,8,13,"That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","This verse warns against opposing Allah and His Messenger, as those who do so will face severe punishment from Allah. It emphasizes the importance of obedience and submission to the commands of Allah and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Opposing their guidance and rejecting their instructions is a grave sin that will be met with a stern penalty in the Hereafter.",ذلك بأنهم شاقوا الله ورسوله ومن يشاقق الله ورسوله فإن الله شديد العقاب
1173,8,14,"That is so; then taste the punishment, for indeed the disbelievers will have the punishment of the Fire.","This verse warns the disbelievers that they will face the severe punishment of Hellfire for rejecting faith and denying the truth. It emphasizes that the consequences of disbelief are real and tangible, and that they will have to ""taste"" the torment as a result of their choices. The interpretation highlights the gravity of disbelief and the certainty of divine justice for those who persistently reject guidance.",ذلكم فذوقوه وأن للكافرين عذاب النار
1174,8,15,"O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve advancing [for battle], do not turn your backs to them.","This verse instructs the believers not to flee from the battlefield when facing the disbelievers in combat. It encourages steadfastness and bravery, prohibiting cowardice and retreat in the face of the enemy. The believers are commanded to stand firm and face the enemy with courage and determination, trusting in Allah's aid and support.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا لقيتم الذين كفروا زحفا فلا تولوهم الأدبار
1175,8,16,"And whoever turns his back to them on such a day, unless manoeuvring for battle or turning to join another company, he indeed has drawn upon himself wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell - an evil destination!","This verse warns against fleeing from the battlefield out of cowardice or weakness of faith. Turning one's back on the enemy, except for tactical manoeuvring or joining another Muslim group, is a grave sin that incurs Allah's wrath and leads to an evil destination in Hell. It emphasizes the importance of steadfastness, courage, and unwavering faith in the face of adversity during battles.",ومن يولهم يومئذ دبره إلا متحرفا لقتال أو متحيزا إلى فئة فقد باء بغضب من الله ومأواه جهنم وبئس المصير
1176,8,17,"So you did not kill them, but it was Allah who killed them. And you threw not, [O Muhammad], when you threw, but it was Allah who threw that He might test the believers with a good test. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, where the Muslims were victorious against the pagan Meccans. It emphasizes that the victory was not due to the Muslims' own strength, but rather it was Allah who granted them victory. The Prophet Muhammad's throwing of a handful of dust at the enemy was merely a symbolic act, while it was Allah who instilled fear in the hearts of the disbelievers. This battle served as a test for the believers, allowing them to prove their faith and gain a noble reward from Allah, who is All-Hearing and All-Knowing.",فلم تقتلوهم ولكن الله قتلهم وما رميت إذ رميت ولكن الله رمى وليبلي المؤمنين منه بلاء حسنا إن الله سميع عليم
1177,8,18,That is because Allah is the One who weakens the plot of the disbelievers.,"This verse indicates that Allah diminishes and renders ineffective the schemes and plots of the disbelievers against the believers and the truth. It is a reassurance that no matter how much the disbelievers conspire and devise plans to undermine the believers, Allah will ultimately nullify their efforts and protect the believers from their harm.",ذلكم وأن الله موهن كيد الكافرين
1178,8,19,"If you [disbelievers] seek the victory - the victory has already come to you. And if you desist [from hostility], it is better for you; but if you return [to war], We will return, and never will you be helped by your [large] company at all, no matter how numerous it is. And indeed, Allah is with the believers.","This verse is a warning to the disbelievers. If they seek victory against the believers, God has already granted victory to the believers. If the disbelievers cease their hostility, it is better for them. But if they persist in aggression, God will aid the believers and the disbelievers will not be helped by their large numbers or armies. Ultimately, God is with the believers and will grant them victory.",إن تستفتحوا فقد جاءكم الفتح وإن تنتهوا فهو خير لكم وإن تعودوا نعد ولن تغني عنكم فئتكم شيئا ولو كثرت وأن الله مع المؤمنين
1179,8,20,"O you who have believed, obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from Him while you hear [His order].",This verse commands the believers to obey Allah's commandments and the teachings of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). It emphasizes the importance of not disobeying or turning away from Allah and His Messenger after having heard and understood their instructions. Obedience to Allah and His Messenger is a fundamental duty for the believers.,يا أيها الذين آمنوا أطيعوا الله ورسوله ولا تولوا عنه وأنتم تسمعون
1180,8,21,"And do not be like those who say, 'We hear,' while they do not hear.","This verse warns against being hypocritical and merely paying lip service to faith without truly understanding or following its teachings. It advises against being like those who claim to listen but do not actually comprehend or act upon what they have heard. The verse emphasizes the importance of sincerity, comprehension, and putting one's beliefs into practice.",ولا تكونوا كالذين قالوا سمعنا وهم لا يسمعون
1181,8,22,"Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason.","This verse emphasizes that those who willfully refuse to listen to the truth and remain silent in acknowledging it, despite having the ability to comprehend it, are considered the worst of creatures in Allah's sight. It condemns the attitude of stubbornly rejecting guidance and failing to use one's intellectual faculties to recognize the truth.",إن شر الدواب عند الله الصم البكم الذين لا يعقلون
1182,8,23,"And if Allah had known any good in them, He would have made them listen; and if He had made them listen, they would have turned away, being averse.","This verse implies that Allah does not guide those whom He knows will not benefit from guidance and will persist in disbelief and rejection of the truth. If Allah knew there was any good or inclination towards faith in their hearts, He would have made them receptive to the message. However, since He knew their inner state of aversion and obstinacy, He did not force them to listen, as they would have still turned away from the truth.",ولو علم الله فيهم خيرا لأسمعهم ولو أسمعهم لتولوا وهم معرضون
1183,8,24,"O you who have believed, respond to Allah and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to Him you will be gathered.","This verse calls upon the believers to obey Allah and His Messenger when they are commanded to do something that will lead to their spiritual and eternal life. It reminds them that Allah has the power to intervene between a person and their heart, meaning He can guide or misguide whomever He wills. Ultimately, all people will be gathered before Allah on the Day of Judgment.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا استجيبوا لله وللرسول إذا دعاكم لما يحييكم واعلموا أن الله يحول بين المرء وقلبه وأنه إليه تحشرون
1184,8,25,"And fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in penalty.",This verse warns believers to be cautious and avoid falling into trials or afflictions that may arise due to wrongdoing. It emphasizes that such trials will not be limited to the wrongdoers alone but may affect others as well. The verse also reminds believers of Allah's severe punishment for those who persist in wrongdoing and disobedience.,واتقوا فتنة لا تصيبن الذين ظلموا منكم خاصة واعلموا أن الله شديد العقاب
1185,8,26,"And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people might abduct you, but He sheltered you, supported you with His victory, and provided you with good things - that you might be grateful.","This verse reminds the believers of their humble beginnings, when they were few in number, oppressed, and living in fear of being persecuted or abducted by their enemies. However, Allah sheltered and protected them, granted them victory and strength, and provided them with lawful and pure sustenance. This is a reminder of Allah's blessings upon them, so that they may be grateful and appreciate the favors bestowed upon them by their Lord.",واذكروا إذ أنتم قليل مستضعفون في الأرض تخافون أن يتخطفكم الناس فآواكم وأيدكم بنصره ورزقكم من الطيبات لعلكم تشكرون
1186,8,27,"O you who have believed, do not betray Allah and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence].","""This verse instructs the believers not to commit treachery against Allah by disobeying His commands, and not to betray the Messenger by rejecting his teachings. It also prohibits betraying the trusts placed upon them, whether they are material trusts like wealth and property, or moral trusts like secrets and covenants. This betrayal is particularly egregious when done knowingly and intentionally.""",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تخونوا الله والرسول وتخونوا أماناتكم وأنتم تعلمون
1187,8,28,And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that it is Allah with whom lies a great reward.,"This verse reminds believers that their wealth and children should not be the ultimate goal in life, as they are merely a test from Allah. True reward and success lie in pleasing Allah and earning His pleasure through righteous deeds and sincere faith.",واعلموا أنما أموالكم وأولادكم فتنة وأن الله عنده أجر عظيم
1188,8,29,"O you who believe! If you obey Allah, He will grant you a criterion [to judge between right and wrong] and will remit from you your evil deeds, and forgive you; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.","This verse encourages believers to have taqwa (consciousness and fear of Allah) by obeying His commands. If they do so, Allah promises them several favors: 1) A furqan, which is a criterion to distinguish truth from falsehood and right from wrong. 2) The remission of their previous sins and evil deeds. 3) Forgiveness from Allah. 4) Attainment of Allah's immense grace and favor. This highlights the great reward and spiritual benefits that come with taqwa.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إن تتقوا الله يجعل لكم فرقانا ويكفر عنكم سيئاتكم ويغفر لكم والله ذو الفضل العظيم

And Allah is the best of planners.","This verse refers to the plots and schemes of the disbelievers against the Prophet Muhammad. They sought to imprison him, kill him, or expel him from Makkah, but Allah was protecting him and planning to defeat their evil schemes. The interpretation highlights that while the disbelievers made their plans, Allah is the best of planners, and His plan ultimately prevailed over their malicious intentions.",وإذ يمكر بك الذين كفروا ليثبتوك أو يقتلوك أو يخرجوك ويمكرون ويمكر الله والله خير الماكرين
1190,8,31,"And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, 'We have heard. If we willed, we could say the like of this. This is not but legends of the former peoples.'","This verse refers to the arrogant attitude of the disbelievers who, when the verses of the Qur'an were recited to them, responded with arrogance and rejection. They claimed that they could produce something similar to the Qur'an if they wished, dismissing it as mere legends of ancient peoples. This interpretation highlights their stubbornness and lack of faith in the face of clear evidence and guidance from Allah.",وإذا تتلى عليهم آياتنا قالوا قد سمعنا لو نشاء لقلنا مثل هذا إن هذا إلا أساطير الأولين
1191,8,32,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when they said, ""O Allah, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment.""","""This verse refers to the arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers who challenged Allah and demanded a punishment if the message brought by the Prophet Muhammad was truly from Allah. Their demand for a sign was not out of a sincere desire to believe, but rather a mockery and rejection of the truth. The interpretation highlights the disbelievers' audacity in demanding a punishment from Allah, despite their disbelief and rejection of His signs and messengers.""",وإذ قالوا اللهم إن كان هذا هو الحق من عندك فأمطر علينا حجارة من السماء أو ائتنا بعذاب أليم
1192,8,33,"And Allah would not punish them while you were among them, nor would Allah punish them while they seek forgiveness.","This verse indicates that as long as the Prophet Muhammad was present among his people and they sought forgiveness from Allah, Allah would not punish them. It suggests that the presence of the Prophet and the act of seeking forgiveness are reasons for Allah's mercy and withholding of punishment.",وما كان الله ليعذبهم وأنت فيهم وما كان الله معذبهم وهم يستغفرون
1193,8,34,"And what is [the matter] with them that they are not punished by Allah while they obstruct [people] from al-Masjid al-Haram, and they were not [supposed to be] its guardians? Its guardians are not but the righteous, but most of them do not know.","Allah questions why He does not punish those who prevent people from the Sacred Mosque in Makkah, when they have no authority over it. The true guardians of the Sacred Mosque are only the pious and God-fearing people, but most of the disbelievers do not understand this reality.",وما لهم ألا يعذبهم الله وهم يصدون عن المسجد الحرام وما كانوا أولياءه إن أولياؤه إلا المتقون ولكن أكثرهم لا يعلمون
1194,8,35,And their prayer at the House was nothing but whistling and handclapping. So taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve.,"This verse condemns the pagan Arabs who mocked and ridiculed the sacred rituals of Islam performed at the Ka'bah. Their ""prayer"" there was merely whistling and handclapping in mockery, rather than sincere worship of Allah. As a result, they are warned to taste the punishment they deserve for their disbelief and rejection of the truth.",وما كان صلاتهم عند البيت إلا مكاء وتصدية فذوقوا العذاب بما كنتم تكفرون
1195,8,36,"Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of Allah. So they will spend it; then it will become for them a [source of] regret; then they will be overcome. And those who have disbelieved - unto Hell they will be gathered.",هذه الآية تحذر من أن الكفار ينفقون أموالهم لصد الناس عن الإيمان بالإسلام، ولكن هذا الإنفاق سيكون مصدر حسرة لهم في نهاية المطاف لأنهم سيُغلبون. والآية تؤكد أيضًا أن الكفار سيُحشرون إلى جهنم يوم القيامة بسبب كفرهم.,إن الذين كفروا ينفقون أموالهم ليصدوا عن سبيل الله فسينفقونها ثم تكون عليهم حسرة ثم يغلبون والذين كفروا إلى جهنم يحشرون
1196,8,37,"That Allah may distinguish the wicked from the good, and place the wicked one upon another and heap them all up and put them into Hell. Those are the losers.","This verse indicates that one of Allah's purposes is to separate the evil from the good. The ""wicked"" or evil people will be piled on top of one another and cast into Hellfire as punishment for their disbelief and wrongdoings. They are described as ""the losers"" because they have lost the great reward of Paradise due to their rejection of faith and righteous conduct.",ليميز الله الخبيث من الطيب ويجعل الخبيث بعضه على بعض فيركمه جميعا فيجعله في جهنم أولئك هم الخاسرون
1197,8,38,"Say to those who disbelieve, 'If they cease, what has passed will be forgiven for them; but if they return, then the precedent of the former peoples has already taken place.'","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad to warn the disbelievers that if they cease their disbelief and accept faith, their past sins will be forgiven. However, if they persist in disbelief, they will face the same fate as previous nations who rejected the messengers of God, which was destruction and punishment.",قل للذين كفروا إن ينتهوا يغفر لهم ما قد سلف وإن يعودوا فقد مضت سنت الأولين
1198,8,39,"And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do.","This verse commands the believers to fight against those who wage war against them and oppress them for their faith, until there is no more persecution (fitnah) and the religion of Islam can be practiced freely without hindrance. However, if the aggressors cease their hostilities, then the Muslims should stop fighting, for Allah sees their actions and will judge them accordingly. The verse emphasizes the importance of establishing religious freedom and protecting the rights of Muslims to practice their faith without oppression.",وقاتلوهم حتى لا تكون فتنة ويكون الدين كله لله فإن انتهوا فإن الله بما يعملون بصير
1199,8,40,"But if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Protector - an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper.","If the disbelievers persist in their rejection and turn away from the truth, know that Allah alone is your Guardian, Protector, and Helper. He is the best Guardian who will protect you, and the best Helper who will aid you against your enemies.",وإن تولوا فاعلموا أن الله مولاكم نعم المولى ونعم النصير
1200,8,41,"And know that whatever you gain as spoils of war, a fifth of it belongs to Allah and the Messenger, and to the near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and what We sent down upon Our servant on the Day of Discrimination, the day when the two forces met; and Allah has power over all things.","This verse lays down the Islamic law of distributing war spoils. One-fifth of the spoils are to be given to Allah and His Messenger (for religious and welfare purposes), relatives of the Prophet, orphans, the poor, and travelers in need. The remaining four-fifths go to the soldiers who participated in the battle. This law was revealed after the Battle of Badr, which was a decisive victory for the outnumbered Muslim forces against the pagan Meccans. The verse emphasizes belief in Allah and the divine revelation given to the Prophet on that momentous ""Day of Discrimination"" between truth and falsehood. It also affirms Allah's complete power and control over all affairs.",واعلموا أنما غنمتم من شيء فأن لله خمسه وللرسول ولذي القربى واليتامى والمساكين وابن السبيل إن كنتم آمنتم بالله وما أنزلنا على عبدنا يوم الفرقان يوم التقى الجمعان والله على كل شيء قدير
1201,8,42,"When you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the farther side, and the caravan was below you. If you had made a mutual appointment, you would have missed the appointment, but this was so that Allah might accomplish a matter already destined - so that those who were to perish might perish by a clear proof and those who were to live might live by a clear proof. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, describing the strategic positioning of the Muslim army and the disbelieving Quraysh army on opposite sides of the valley. It emphasizes that the encounter was destined by Allah to serve as a clear test and proof, allowing those who were destined to perish to do so after witnessing clear evidence, and those destined to live to survive after witnessing clear evidence. It highlights Allah's wisdom, power, and knowledge in orchestrating events according to His divine plan.",إذ أنتم بالعدوة الدنيا وهم بالعدوة القصوى والركب أسفل منكم ولو تواعدتم لاختلفتم في الميعاد ولكن ليقضي الله أمرا كان مفعولا ليهلك من هلك عن بينة ويحيى من حي عن بينة وإن الله لسميع عليم
1202,8,43,"When Allah showed them to you in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many, you would have faltered and disputed in the matter, but Allah saved you; surely He is Aware of what is in the breasts.","The interpretation of this verse is that Allah showed the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) a vision in his dream, depicting the enemy forces as few in number. This was a divine strategy to instill courage and determination in the hearts of the believers, as seeing a small enemy force would prevent them from faltering or disputing the decision to engage in battle. Had the enemy been shown as numerous, it could have led to hesitation and disagreement among the believers. However, Allah protected them from such doubts, as He is fully aware of the intentions and thoughts within people's hearts.",إذ يريكهم الله في منامك قليلا ولو أراكهم كثيرا لفشلتم ولتنازعتم في الأمر ولكن الله سلم إنه عليم بذات الصدور

It emphasizes that the outcome of events is determined by Allah's will, and all matters ultimately return to Him.",وإذ يريكموهم إذ التقيتم في أعينكم قليلا ويقللكم في أعينهم ليقضي الله أمرا كان مفعولا وإلى الله ترجع الأمور
1204,8,45,"O you who have believed, when you meet a company [from the enemy forces], stand firm and remember Allah much that you may be successful.","This verse instructs the believers to remain steadfast and unwavering in the face of the enemy, and to constantly remember and invoke Allah's name and assistance, for that is the key to achieving victory and success.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا لقيتم فئة فاثبتوا واذكروا الله كثيرا لعلكم تفلحون
1205,8,46,"And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute lest you falter and your strength depart; and be patient, for Allah is with the patient.","The verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. It warns against disputing and quarreling, as this can lead to failure and the loss of strength and resolve. Instead, it encourages patience, promising that Allah is with those who are patient and steadfast.",وأطيعوا الله ورسوله ولا تنازعوا فتفشلوا وتذهب ريحكم واصبروا إن الله مع الصابرين
1206,8,47,"And do not be like those who came out of their homes boastfully and to be seen by people, and hindered [others] from the way of Allah, and Allah is encompassing of what they do.","This verse warns against being arrogant, boastful, and seeking fame and recognition from people. It condemns those who left their homes with pride and ostentation, showing off their wealth and status, while preventing others from following the path of Allah. The verse emphasizes that Allah is fully aware of their actions and will hold them accountable.",ولا تكونوا كالذين خرجوا من ديارهم بطرا ورئاء الناس ويصدون عن سبيل الله والله بما يعملون محيط
1207,8,48,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said, 'No one can overcome you today from among the people, and indeed, I am your protector.' But when the two armies sighted one another, he turned on his heels and said, 'Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I see what you do not see; indeed I fear Allah, and Allah is severe in penalty.'","This verse refers to the Battle of Badr, when Satan tried to deceive the disbelievers by making their deeds seem pleasing to them and promising them victory. However, when the two armies faced each other, Satan abandoned the disbelievers, claiming that he could see what they could not and that he feared Allah's punishment. The verse highlights Satan's deception and the ultimate reality that he has no power over those who fear Allah.",وإذ زين لهم الشيطان أعمالهم وقال لا غالب لكم اليوم من الناس وإني جار لكم فلما تراءت الفئتان نكص على عقبيه وقال إني بريء منكم إني أرى ما لا ترون إني أخاف الله والله شديد العقاب

But whoever relies upon Allah - then indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","This verse refers to the hypocrites and those with doubts in their hearts mocking the sincere believers, claiming that their religion has deluded them. However, the interpretation emphasizes that those who truly rely on Allah will find that He is Almighty and Wise, implying that the believers' trust in Allah is well-founded, and the doubters are the ones who are misguided.",إذ يقول المنافقون والذين في قلوبهم مرض غر هؤلاء دينهم ومن يتوكل على الله فإن الله عزيز حكيم
1209,8,50,"And if you could but see when the disbelievers are in the agonies of death, the angels are striking their faces and their backs, [saying], ""Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.""","This verse paints a vivid and terrifying picture of the disbelievers' fate in the Hereafter. The angels, who are God's obedient servants, strike the disbelievers on their faces and backs as they are experiencing the agonies of death. This striking is a form of humiliation and punishment for their rejection of faith. The angels then command them to ""Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire,"" which is a reference to the eternal torment of Hell that awaits them as a consequence of their disbelief and disobedience to God.",ولو ترى إذ يتوفى الذين كفروا الملائكة يضربون وجوههم وأدبارهم وذوقوا عذاب الحريق
1210,8,51,"That is for what your hands have sent forth, and verily, Allah is not unjust to His slaves.","""This punishment that has befallen you is a consequence of your own misdeeds and sins.

1211,8,52,"Like the behavior of Pharaoh's people and those before them. They disbelieved in Allah's signs, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and severe in penalty.","This verse draws a parallel between the arrogant rejection of faith by Pharaoh's people and those before them, and the disbelievers of the Prophet's time. Just as the previous nations denied Allah's signs and revelations, they too were guilty of the same transgression. As a consequence, Allah punished them severely for their sins and disobedience, for He is truly Mighty and capable of inflicting a severe punishment upon those who defy Him.",كدأب آل فرعون والذين من قبلهم كفروا بآيات الله فأخذهم الله بذنوبهم إن الله قوي شديد العقاب
1212,8,53,"That is because Allah would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves, and because Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.","This verse explains that Allah does not take away His blessings and favors from a people unless they themselves change their beliefs, attitudes, and actions. Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing, so He is aware of the changes that occur within people's hearts and minds. The continuation or withdrawal of Allah's favors depends on whether people maintain faith and righteousness or deviate from the right path.",ذلك بأن الله لم يك مغيرا نعمة أنعمها على قوم حتى يغيروا ما بأنفسهم وأن الله سميع عليم

And all were wrongdoers.","This verse draws a parallel between the disbelief and rejection of the signs of Allah by the people of Pharaoh and previous nations. It serves as a warning that those who deny the clear signs and revelations from their Lord will face a similar fate of destruction due to their sins and wrongdoings, just as Pharaoh and his people were drowned for their oppression and rejection of faith.",كدأب آل فرعون والذين من قبلهم كذبوا بآيات ربهم فأهلكناهم بذنوبهم وأغرقنا آل فرعون وكل كانوا ظالمين
1214,8,55,"Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are those who have disbelieved, and they will not [ever] believe.","This verse emphasizes that the most despicable and vile creatures in the sight of Allah are those who have rejected faith and refuse to believe in Him, despite being presented with clear signs and evidence. Their stubborn disbelief and rejection of the truth makes them the lowest of beings in Allah's estimation. The interpretation highlights the grave consequence of willful disbelief and warns against persisting in such a state.",إن شر الدواب عند الله الذين كفروا فهم لا يؤمنون
1215,8,56,"Those with whom you made a covenant, but they break their covenant every time, and they do not fear Allah.","This verse refers to those who repeatedly break their promises and covenants with the Muslims, violating their treaties and agreements without any fear of Allah's punishment. It condemns their treacherous behavior and lack of taqwa (consciousness of Allah). The interpretation emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's promises and warns against betraying trusts and treaties, as such actions are displeasing to Allah.",الذين عاهدت منهم ثم ينقضون عهدهم في كل مرة وهم لا يتقون
1216,8,57,"So if you gain victory over them in war, deal with them in a way that will disperse those behind them, so that they may take heed.","This verse instructs that if the believers gain victory over the disbelievers in battle, they should disperse and scatter the remaining enemy forces in a way that serves as a deterrent and causes them to remember Allah's punishment. The goal is to weaken the enemy's resolve and prevent further aggression, not to seek revenge or inflict unnecessary harm.",فإما تثقفنهم في الحرب فشرد بهم من خلفهم لعلهم يذكرون
1217,8,58,"But if you fear betrayal from any people, then throw (their treaty) back to them on equal terms.

Indeed, they will not cause failure [to Allah].",This verse warns the disbelievers not to think that they can escape from Allah's punishment or cause failure to His plans. It emphasizes that their disbelief and opposition will not prevent Allah's will from being fulfilled. They cannot undermine or frustrate Allah's decree in any way.,ولا يحسبن الذين كفروا سبقوا إنهم لا يعجزون

It also indicates that there may be other unknown enemies besides the known ones, but Allah knows them all. Additionally, it promises that any expenditure made in the cause of Allah will be fully recompensed, and no one will be treated unjustly.",وأعدوا لهم ما استطعتم من قوة ومن رباط الخيل ترهبون به عدو الله وعدوكم وآخرين من دونهم لا تعلمونهم الله يعلمهم وما تنفقوا من شيء في سبيل الله يوف إليكم وأنتم لا تظلمون
1220,8,61,"But if they incline to peace, then incline to it and trust in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.","If the opponents show an inclination towards peace and reconciliation, Muslims should respond in a like manner and agree to peaceful terms.

Indeed, He is Exalted in Might and Wise.","This verse highlights the immense power and wisdom of Allah in uniting the hearts of believers.

And if there are a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, for they are a people who do not understand.","Allah encourages the believers to fight against the disbelievers, even if they are outnumbered. If there are twenty steadfast believers, they can overcome two hundred disbelievers. And if there are a hundred believers, they can overcome a thousand disbelievers. This is because the disbelievers lack true understanding and faith, which gives the believers strength and determination to fight for the cause of Allah.",يا أيها النبي حرض المؤمنين على القتال إن يكن منكم عشرون صابرون يغلبوا مائتين وإن يكن منكم مائة يغلبوا ألفا من الذين كفروا بأنهم قوم لا يفقهون

And Allah is with the steadfast.","This verse is providing reassurance and encouragement to the believers. It acknowledges their weakness and human frailties, and informs them that Allah has lightened their burden. It then states that if they remain steadfast and patient, even a small number of them can overcome a much larger force, by Allah's permission and support. The key message is that steadfastness, patience, and reliance on Allah are crucial for success, even against overwhelming odds.",الآن خفف الله عنكم وعلم أن فيكم ضعفا فإن يكن منكم مائة صابرة يغلبوا مائتين وإن يكن منكم ألف يغلبوا ألفين بإذن الله والله مع الصابرين
1226,8,67,"It is not for a Prophet to have captives until he has thoroughly subdued the land. You desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.","The interpretation is that this verse addresses the wisdom behind taking captives in war. It states that a Prophet should not take captives until he has thoroughly subdued the land and established authority. The verse contrasts the temporary desires of this world with the eternal reward of the Hereafter, which Allah desires for the believers. It emphasizes that Allah is Mighty and Wise in His commands and laws.",ما كان لنبي أن يكون له أسرى حتى يثخن في الأرض تريدون عرض الدنيا والله يريد الآخرة والله عزيز حكيم
1227,8,68,"Had it not been for a decree from Allah that had already gone forth, there would have touched you, for what you took, a great punishment.","This verse indicates that if it were not for Allah's mercy and pre-existing decree to delay the punishment, the believers would have received a severe punishment for the sin they committed. It emphasizes Allah's forgiveness and that He does not hasten the punishment for His servants, giving them a chance to repent and seek forgiveness.",لولا كتاب من الله سبق لمسكم فيما أخذتم عذاب عظيم
1228,8,69,"So consume what you have acquired as ghanimah (war booty), lawful and good, and fear Allah. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","This verse encourages the believers to enjoy the lawful and pure spoils of war that they have attained through battle, but to remain conscious of Allah and His commandments. It reminds them that although they have been granted victory and spoils, they should not become arrogant or transgress the limits set by Allah. Instead, they should maintain their piety and seek forgiveness from the Most Merciful, for any shortcomings or excesses.",فكلوا مما غنمتم حلالا طيبا واتقوا الله إن الله غفور رحيم
1229,8,70,"O Prophet, say to the captives in your hands, 'If Allah knows any good in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.'","This verse addresses the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the captives taken during the Battle of Badr. It instructs him to tell the captives that if Allah finds goodness in their hearts, He will compensate them with something better than what they have lost, and He will forgive them. This demonstrates Allah's mercy and willingness to pardon those who have faith and repent, even if they were previously enemies of Islam.",يا أيها النبي قل لمن في أيديكم من الأسرى إن يعلم الله في قلوبكم خيرا يؤتكم خيرا مما أخذ منكم ويغفر لكم والله غفور رحيم
1230,8,71,"And if they intend to deceive you, they have already deceived Allah before. But He enabled you to prevail over them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","This verse implies that if the disbelievers intend to betray the Prophet Muhammad, they have already betrayed Allah by disbelieving in Him and His messengers before. However, Allah has granted the Prophet victory over them, as He is All-Knowing of their intentions and All-Wise in His plans and decrees.",وإن يريدوا خيانتك فقد خانوا الله من قبل فأمكن منهم والله عليم حكيم
1231,8,72,"Indeed, those who have believed and emigrated and fought with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah and those who gave shelter and aided - they are allies of one another. But those who believed and did not emigrate - for you there is no guardianship of them until they emigrate. And if they seek help of you for the religion, then you must help, except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.","This verse outlines the relationship and mutual obligations between the Muhajirun (emigrants) and Ansar (helpers) in Medina. It states that those who believed, migrated from Mecca, and strived with their wealth and lives for Allah's cause, as well as those who sheltered and supported them in Medina, are allies to one another. However, those who believed but did not migrate have no such alliance until they migrate. If they seek help for the sake of religion, it is obligatory to help them, except against people with whom there is a treaty. Allah is aware of all actions.",إن الذين آمنوا وهاجروا وجاهدوا بأموالهم وأنفسهم في سبيل الله والذين آووا ونصروا أولئك بعضهم أولياء بعض والذين آمنوا ولم يهاجروا ما لكم من ولايتهم من شيء حتى يهاجروا وإن استنصروكم في الدين فعليكم النصر إلا على قوم بينكم وبينهم ميثاق والله بما تعملون بصير
1232,8,73,"And those who disbelieved are allies of one another. Unless you do this [disengage from the disbelievers], there will be persecution on earth and great corruption.","This verse warns against forming alliances or close relationships with disbelievers, as they will influence and misguide the believers away from the truth. If the believers do not maintain distance from the disbelievers, it will lead to trials, oppression, and widespread moral decay in society. The interpretation emphasizes the importance of preserving one's faith and values by avoiding close ties with those who reject the truth.",والذين كفروا بعضهم أولياء بعض إلا تفعلوه تكن فتنة في الأرض وفساد كبير
1233,8,74,"And those who believe and emigrate and strive in the cause of Allah, and those who shelter and support them, it is they who are the true believers. For them is forgiveness and a noble provision.","This verse highlights the virtues of those who embraced faith, migrated for the sake of Allah, strived in His cause, and supported and sheltered the believers. It affirms that these individuals are the true believers, and they will be rewarded with forgiveness from Allah and a noble provision in the Hereafter.",والذين آمنوا وهاجروا وجاهدوا في سبيل الله والذين آووا ونصروا أولئك هم المؤمنون حقا لهم مغفرة ورزق كريم
1234,8,75,"And those who believed after [the early believers] and emigrated and fought with you - they are of you. But those of blood relation are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of Allah.

However, it also upholds the rights of blood relatives in matters of inheritance, as ordained by Allah, who knows all things.",والذين آمنوا من بعد وهاجروا وجاهدوا معكم فأولئك منكم وأولو الأرحام بعضهم أولى ببعض في كتاب الله إن الله بكل شيء عليم
1235,9,1,A disavowal from Allah and His Messenger to those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists.,"This verse announces the nullification of all treaties and covenants made with the polytheists who violated their terms. It signifies that Allah and His Messenger disassociate themselves from those who broke their pledges and betrayed the Muslims, giving them a period of four months to make amends or face the consequences.",براءة من الله ورسوله إلى الذين عاهدتم من المشركين
1236,9,2,"So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land for four months, but know that you cannot cause failure to Allah, and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.","The interpretation is that Allah is giving a period of four months to the disbelievers to roam freely in the land before facing punishment. However, they should understand that they cannot escape Allah's plan or overpower Him, and that Allah will eventually humiliate and disgrace those who reject faith.",فسيحوا في الأرض أربعة أشهر واعلموا أنكم غير معجزي الله وأن الله مخزي الكافرين
1237,9,3,"And [it is] an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah is disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not cause failure to Allah. And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.","This verse announces Allah's disassociation from the polytheists and disbelievers after the period of respite granted to them. It calls them to repent and embrace Islam, promising them good if they do so, but warning them of a painful punishment if they persist in their disbelief and turn away from the truth.",وأذان من الله ورسوله إلى الناس يوم الحج الأكبر أن الله بريء من المشركين ورسوله فإن تبتم فهو خير لكم وإن توليتم فاعلموا أنكم غير معجزي الله وبشر الذين كفروا بعذاب أليم
1238,9,4,"Except for those with whom you made a covenant among the polytheists; then they have not been deficient toward you in anything and have not supported anyone against you, so complete for them their covenant until their term [has ended]. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him].",هذه الآية تتحدث عن استثناء لبعض المشركين الذين كان للمسلمين معاهدة معهم ولم ينقضوها. فالله يأمر المسلمين بالوفاء بالعهود والمواثيق التي أبرموها مع هؤلاء المشركين إلى نهاية مدتها، طالما أنهم لم ينقصوا المسلمين شيئًا ولم يساندوا أحدًا ضدهم. ويختتم الله الآية بالإشارة إلى أنه يحب المتقين الذين يخافونه ويلتزمون بأوامره.,إلا الذين عاهدتم من المشركين ثم لم ينقصوكم شيئا ولم يظاهروا عليكم أحدا فأتموا إليهم عهدهم إلى مدتهم إن الله يحب المتقين
1239,9,5,"But when the sacred months have passed, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.","This verse instructs the believers to fight against the idolaters who violated their treaties and persecuted the Muslims after the sacred months have ended. It permits the use of force against them, but also offers amnesty if they repent, establish prayer, and pay the prescribed charity. The interpretation highlights that while fighting is permitted as a last resort, the door to peace remains open if the enemy abandons hostility and embraces Islam.",فإذا انسلخ الأشهر الحرم فاقتلوا المشركين حيث وجدتموهم وخذوهم واحصروهم واقعدوا لهم كل مرصد فإن تابوا وأقاموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة فخلوا سبيلهم إن الله غفور رحيم
1240,9,6,"And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then protect him so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.","This verse instructs the believers to grant protection and safe passage to any polytheist who seeks refuge with them, even if he is an enemy. This is to be done so that the polytheist can hear and understand the teachings of Islam without fear. After hearing the message, he should be escorted to a place of safety, regardless of whether he accepts Islam or not. The reason given is that the polytheists are ignorant of the truth due to their lack of knowledge.",وإن أحد من المشركين استجارك فأجره حتى يسمع كلام الله ثم أبلغه مأمنه ذلك بأنهم قوم لا يعلمون
1241,9,7,"How can there be a covenant of protection with Allah and His Messenger for the polytheists, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them. Verily, Allah loves the pious.","This verse addresses the issue of treaties and covenants with the polytheists. It states that there can be no covenant of protection with Allah and His Messenger for the polytheists, except for those with whom the Muslims made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque in Makkah. As long as those polytheists uphold their part of the treaty and remain faithful to it, the Muslims must also honor their commitment. This verse emphasizes the importance of fulfilling promises and covenants, as Allah loves those who are God-fearing and upright.",كيف يكون للمشركين عهد عند الله وعند رسوله إلا الذين عاهدتم عند المسجد الحرام فما استقاموا لكم فاستقيموا لهم إن الله يحب المتقين
1242,9,8,"How [can there be a treaty], while if they were to overcome you, they would not leave you any leeway, nor honor any tie with you? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse, and most of them are defiantly disobedient.","This verse is warning against making treaties or alliances with those who do not honor their commitments and have ill intentions. It states that even if they appear friendly outwardly, their hearts are opposed to you, and they will not uphold any agreement if they gain the upper hand. Most of them are disobedient to God and will readily violate their promises. The verse cautions against being deceived by outward displays of amity from those whose true intentions are hostile.",كيف وإن يظهروا عليكم لا يرقبوا فيكم إلا ولا ذمة يرضونكم بأفواههم وتأبى قلوبهم وأكثرهم فاسقون
1243,9,9,They have bartered away the signs of Allah for a paltry price and have turned others away from His path. Evil indeed is what they have been doing.,This verse condemns those who reject or trade away Allah's signs and revelations for temporary worldly gains or pleasures. They disbelieve in Allah's messages and hinder others from following the right path. Their actions are described as evil and displeasing in the sight of Allah.,اشتروا بآيات الله ثمنا قليلا فصدوا عن سبيله إنهم ساء ما كانوا يعملون
1244,9,10,They respect not the ties of kinship or covenant in the case of a believer. It is they who are the transgressors.,"This verse condemns those who disregard family ties and covenants when dealing with believers. It criticizes their disrespect for the bonds that should unite people, especially with fellow believers. Their transgression lies in violating these sacred ties and failing to uphold moral obligations towards their brethren in faith.",لا يرقبون في مؤمن إلا ولا ذمة وأولئك هم المعتدون
1245,9,11,"But if they repent, establish prayer and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail the verses for a people who know.","If those who previously opposed the truth repent, perform the obligatory prayers, and pay the obligatory charity, then they become part of the Muslim brotherhood.

1246,9,12,"But if they violate their oaths after their covenant and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief - indeed, they have no faithfulness; perhaps they will cease.","If the disbelievers break their treaties and covenants with you, and insult and attack your religion, then fight their leaders and authorities who are the cause of disbelief and war. They have no regard for oaths or promises, so fight them in the hope that they will stop their aggression and oppression.",وإن نكثوا أيمانهم من بعد عهدهم وطعنوا في دينكم فقاتلوا أئمة الكفر إنهم لا أيمان لهم لعلهم ينتهون
1247,9,13,"Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and intended to expel the Messenger, and they had begun [the attack upon] you the first time? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are [truly] believers.","Allah is questioning the believers, reprimanding them for hesitating to fight the disbelievers who broke their covenants, plotted to expel the Prophet from Makkah, and initiated hostilities against the Muslims first. He reminds them that if they are true believers, they should fear Allah more than fearing these disbelievers, for Allah is more deserving of being feared and obeyed.",ألا تقاتلون قوما نكثوا أيمانهم وهموا بإخراج الرسول وهم بدءوكم أول مرة أتخشونهم فالله أحق أن تخشوه إن كنتم مؤمنين
1248,9,14,Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people.,"This verse is interpreted as a command to the believers to fight against the disbelievers and enemies of Islam. It promises that Allah will inflict punishment on them through the hands of the believers, humiliate them, grant victory to the believers, and bring contentment and satisfaction to the hearts of the believing people who have suffered at the hands of the enemies.",قاتلوهم يعذبهم الله بأيديكم ويخزهم وينصركم عليهم ويشف صدور قوم مؤمنين
1249,9,15,"And the rage departs from their hearts. And Allah pardons whom He wills. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.","This verse indicates that true believers will have their anger and rage removed from their hearts by Allah's grace. It also affirms Allah's attribute of pardoning whomever He wills from among His servants, as He is the All-Knowing and All-Wise who judges perfectly.",ويذهب غيظ قلوبهم ويتوب الله على من يشاء والله عليم حكيم
1250,9,16,"Or do you think that you would be left alone while Allah has not yet made evident those among you who strive [for His cause] and do not take other than Allah, His Messenger and the believers as allies?

It emphasizes that Allah will make evident those who truly strive in His path and do not take allies other than Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. Allah is fully aware of all that they do.",أم حسبتم أن تتركوا ولما يعلم الله الذين جاهدوا منكم ولم يتخذوا من دون الله ولا رسوله ولا المؤمنين وليجة والله خبير بما تعملون
1251,9,17,"It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against themselves with disbelief. For them, their deeds have become worthless, and they will abide eternally in the Fire.","This verse denies the polytheists the right to maintain or take care of the mosques of Allah, which are meant for the worship of the One True God. Their deeds of polytheism render all their efforts futile and worthless, and they will be condemned to eternal punishment in the Hellfire for rejecting faith and persisting in disbelief.",ما كان للمشركين أن يعمروا مساجد الله شاهدين على أنفسهم بالكفر أولئك حبطت أعمالهم وفي النار هم خالدون
1252,9,18,"The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, and give zakah and do not fear except Allah, for it is expected that those will be of the [rightly] guided.","This verse emphasizes that the true caretakers and maintainers of the mosques are those who have sincere faith in Allah and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, pay the obligatory charity (zakah), and fear none but Allah. Such believers are expected to be among the rightly guided ones who follow the straight path. The verse highlights the importance of faith, worship, charity, and sincere devotion to Allah as essential qualities for those entrusted with the upkeep and sanctity of mosques.",إنما يعمر مساجد الله من آمن بالله واليوم الآخر وأقام الصلاة وآتى الزكاة ولم يخش إلا الله فعسى أولئك أن يكونوا من المهتدين
1253,9,19,Have you made the providing of water for the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to the one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.,This verse emphasizes that performing good deeds like providing water for pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque is not equal to having true faith and striving in Allah's cause. True believers who have faith and struggle for Allah's religion are superior in the sight of Allah. The wrongdoers who lack faith and do not strive for Allah's cause will not be guided by Him.,أجعلتم سقاية الحاج وعمارة المسجد الحرام كمن آمن بالله واليوم الآخر وجاهد في سبيل الله لا يستوون عند الله والله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين

1255,9,21,"Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Him, and His good pleasure, and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure","This verse indicates that Allah promises the believers a life of eternal bliss in Paradise. They will receive Allah's mercy, be pleased with Him, and dwell in gardens of everlasting delight. The ""mercy"" refers to Allah's forgiveness and blessings, while His ""good pleasure"" signifies His acceptance of their faith and deeds. The ""gardens"" symbolize the reward of Paradise with all its pleasures and comforts that will never end.",يبشرهم ربهم برحمة منه ورضوان وجنات لهم فيها نعيم مقيم
1256,9,22,"Abiding forever therein. Indeed, Allah has a great reward with Him.","This verse promises the believers that they will dwell forever in Paradise, which is the ultimate reward and honor granted by Allah to those who have faith and do righteous deeds.

1257,9,23,"O you who have believed, do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.","Allah commands the believers not to take their disbelieving fathers, brothers, or any close relatives as allies if they prefer disbelief over faith. Maintaining allegiance to disbelievers who reject faith is an act of wrongdoing and goes against the principles of Islam. The bond of faith supersedes blood relations when it comes to matters of belief and disbelief.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تتخذوا آباءكم وإخوانكم أولياء إن استحبوا الكفر على الإيمان ومن يتولهم منكم فأولئك هم الظالمون
1258,9,24,"Say, 'If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have acquired, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command.

It warns believers that if they prioritize their family ties, wealth, business interests, or comfortable lifestyles over their devotion to Allah, His Messenger, and the struggle for His cause, they should be prepared to face the consequences of Allah's judgment. True guidance comes only from Allah, and those who defiantly disobey His commands will be deprived of His guidance.",قل إن كان آباؤكم وأبناؤكم وإخوانكم وأزواجكم وعشيرتكم وأموال اقترفتموها وتجارة تخشون كسادها ومساكن ترضونها أحب إليكم من الله ورسوله وجهاد في سبيله فتربصوا حتى يأتي الله بأمره والله لا يهدي القوم الفاسقين
1259,9,25,"Indeed, Allah has already helped you in many situations, including on the Day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth became constrained for you in spite of its vastness, and you turned your backs in retreat.","The verse reminds the believers of Allah's favor upon them in granting them victory despite their weakness and small numbers, as was the case in the Battle of Hunayn. It highlights that relying on one's material strength and numbers alone is futile without faith and trust in Allah. The vastness of the earth could not aid them when they were overcome by fear and began to flee. It serves as a lesson in humility, recognizing one's complete dependence on Allah's support.",لقد نصركم الله في مواطن كثيرة ويوم حنين إذ أعجبتكم كثرتكم فلم تغن عنكم شيئا وضاقت عليكم الأرض بما رحبت ثم وليتم مدبرين
1260,9,26,"Then Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and sent down forces which you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. And that is the recompense of the disbelievers.","This verse refers to the Battle of Hunayn, where the Muslims initially faced setback but were ultimately victorious with Allah's help. The ""tranquillity"" mentioned is the spiritual peace and reassurance that Allah bestowed upon the believers. The ""forces"" are the angels that Allah sent to aid the Muslims. The disbelievers were punished for their rejection of faith, highlighting that denying Allah's truth has consequences.",ثم أنزل الله سكينته على رسوله وعلى المؤمنين وأنزل جنودا لم تروها وعذب الذين كفروا وذلك جزاء الكافرين
1261,9,27,"Then Allah will accept the repentance of whom He wills; and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.","This verse highlights Allah's infinite mercy and wisdom. It indicates that after the Day of Judgment, Allah will forgive whomever He wills from among the believers who sincerely repented. The decision of whose repentance to accept lies solely with Allah based on His perfect knowledge and wisdom. This underscores the importance of sincere repentance in this life and Allah's boundless forgiveness and compassion for those who turn to Him.",ثم يتوب الله من بعد ذلك على من يشاء والله غفور رحيم
1262,9,28,"O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-Haram after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise.","This verse establishes a prohibition for the polytheists to approach the Sacred Mosque in Makkah after the final period granted to them. It signifies the purification of the Sacred Mosque from the filth of polytheism and idolatry. The believers are reassured that if they fear poverty due to the loss of trade with the polytheists, Allah will compensate them through His infinite bounties and provisions, for He is All-Knowing and All-Wise in His decisions and decrees.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إنما المشركون نجس فلا يقربوا المسجد الحرام بعد عامهم هذا وإن خفتم عيلة فسوف يغنيكم الله من فضله إن شاء إن الله عليم حكيم

However, it allows for peaceful coexistence if they pay the jizyah tax and acknowledge the authority of the Muslim state while living under its protection.""",قاتلوا الذين لا يؤمنون بالله ولا باليوم الآخر ولا يحرمون ما حرم الله ورسوله ولا يدينون دين الحق من الذين أوتوا الكتاب حتى يعطوا الجزية عن يد وهم صاغرون
1264,9,30,"The Jews say, ""Ezra is the son of Allah,"" and the Christians say, ""The Messiah is the son of Allah."" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?","This verse addresses the false beliefs held by Jews and Christians regarding the status of Ezra and Jesus, peace be upon them, as ""sons of God."" It condemns such claims as a form of disbelief, likening them to the statements of previous disbelievers. The verse emphasizes that these are mere utterances from their mouths, imitating earlier misguided people. It invokes Allah's curse upon them for their delusion and deviation from the truth.",وقالت اليهود عزير ابن الله وقالت النصارى المسيح ابن الله ذلك قولهم بأفواههم يضاهئون قول الذين كفروا من قبل قاتلهم الله أنى يؤفكون
1265,9,31,"They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah, and the Messiah, son of Mary; though they were commanded to worship but One God, there is no god but He, glorified be He from what they associate!","This verse criticizes those who blindly follow religious leaders and give them the status of lords besides Allah. It emphasizes that true worship should be directed solely to Allah, and associating partners with Him is a form of shirk (polytheism) that goes against the core teachings of Islam.",اتخذوا أحبارهم ورهبانهم أربابا من دون الله والمسيح ابن مريم وما أمروا إلا ليعبدوا إلها واحدا لا إله إلا هو سبحانه عما يشركون

However, Allah insists on completing His light and making His religion prevail, despite the disbelievers"" opposition and hatred towards it.",يريدون أن يطفئوا نور الله بأفواههم ويأبى الله إلا أن يتم نوره ولو كره الكافرون
1267,9,33,"It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over all [other] religions, even though the polytheists dislike it.","This verse affirms that Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the message of Islam - the true religion that guides people to the straight path. The purpose is for Islam to prevail over all other religions and ways of life, despite the opposition and dislike of the polytheists and disbelievers. It signifies the ultimate triumph of the truth over falsehood.",هو الذي أرسل رسوله بالهدى ودين الحق ليظهره على الدين كله ولو كره المشركون
1268,9,34,"O you who have believed, indeed many of the Jewish scholars and the Christian monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert [them] from the way of Allah . And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah - give them tidings of a painful punishment.","This verse warns against the corrupt practices of some religious leaders who exploit people's wealth unjustly and misguide them from Allah's path. It also condemns hoarding wealth and not spending it in righteous causes, promising a painful punishment for those who do so.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إن كثيرا من الأحبار والرهبان ليأكلون أموال الناس بالباطل ويصدون عن سبيل الله والذين يكنزون الذهب والفضة ولا ينفقونها في سبيل الله فبشرهم بعذاب أليم
1269,9,35,"The Day they will be dragged into the Fire of Hell on their faces, [it will be said], 'Taste the touch of Hell.'","This verse warns of the severe punishment that awaits the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection. They will be dragged into the blazing fire of Hell, and their faces, sides, and backs will be seared by its intense heat. This torment is a consequence of their own actions, as they accumulated and hoarded wealth in this world instead of spending it in obedience to Allah. The phrase ""Taste the touch of Hell"" is a stern rebuke, indicating that they will experience the full intensity of Hell's punishment as a result of their greed and disbelief.",يوم يحمى عليها في نار جهنم فتكوى بها جباههم وجنوبهم وظهورهم هذا ما كنزتم لأنفسكم فذوقوا ما كنتم تكنزون
1270,9,36,"Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred. That is the correct religion, so do not wrong yourselves during them. And fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that Allah is with the righteous [who fear Him].","This verse establishes the Islamic calendar as consisting of twelve lunar months, four of which are sacred months in which fighting is prohibited except in self-defense. It commands the believers to fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against the believers collectively, but reminds them that Allah is with the righteous who fear Him.",إن عدة الشهور عند الله اثنا عشر شهرا في كتاب الله يوم خلق السماوات والأرض منها أربعة حرم ذلك الدين القيم فلا تظلموا فيهن أنفسكم وقاتلوا المشركين كافة كما يقاتلونكم كافة واعلموا أن الله مع المتقين
1271,9,37,"Verily, the postponing (of the Sacred Months) is an addition to disbelief: thereby the disbelievers are led astray, for they allow it one year and forbid it another year, that they may agree with the number (of months) that Allah has made sacred, thus making allowable what Allah has forbidden.","This verse condemns the pagan Arab practice of postponing the sacred months to allow warfare during those months, which was forbidden. It states that this ""postponing"" is an addition to disbelief that leads the disbelievers further astray. They would sometimes allow warfare during a sacred month one year, then forbid it the next year, violating the sanctity that Allah had decreed for those months. This manipulation to suit their desires made allowable what Allah had forbidden, and their evil deeds were made appealing to them. However, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",إنما النسيء زيادة في الكفر يضل به الذين كفروا يحلونه عاما ويحرمونه عاما ليواطئوا عدة ما حرم الله فيحلوا ما حرم الله زين لهم سوء أعمالهم والله لا يهدي القوم الكافرين
1272,9,38,"O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of Allah (i.e. Jihad) you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter.","""This verse is addressing the believers, questioning their reluctance to participate in jihad (struggle in the cause of Allah) when called upon. It rebukes those who cling heavily to the worldly life and prefer its temporary pleasures over the everlasting rewards of the Hereafter. The verse emphasizes that the enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant and short-lived compared to the eternal bliss of the Hereafter. It encourages the believers to prioritize their spiritual pursuits and strive for the sake of Allah, rather than being attached to the fleeting comforts of this world.""",يا أيها الذين آمنوا ما لكم إذا قيل لكم انفروا في سبيل الله اثاقلتم إلى الأرض أرضيتم بالحياة الدنيا من الآخرة فما متاع الحياة الدنيا في الآخرة إلا قليل
1273,9,39,"But if you turn away, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people, and you will not harm Him at all. And Allah is over all things competent.","This verse is a stern warning to the believers to not turn away from obeying Allah and His Messenger. If they do so, Allah will inflict a severe punishment upon them and replace them with another people who will obey Him. The verse emphasizes that no one can cause any harm to Allah, for He is All-Powerful and has absolute control over all affairs.",إلا تنفروا يعذبكم عذابا أليما ويستبدل قوما غيركم ولا تضروه شيئا والله على كل شيء قدير
1274,9,40,"If you do not aid the Prophet - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, 'Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.' And Allah sent down His tranquillity upon him and supported him with soldiers you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah - that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.",إن هذه الآية تشير إلى حادثة الهجرة النبوية من مكة إلى المدينة، حيث كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ورفيقه أبو بكر الصديق رضي الله عنه في الغار، ويؤكد الله تعالى أنه معهما ويؤيدهما ويحميهما من الكافرين. كما تشير إلى نصر الله للنبي وإعلاء كلمته على كلمة الكافرين، مهما بلغت قوتهم وكيدهم.,إلا تنصروه فقد نصره الله إذ أخرجه الذين كفروا ثاني اثنين إذ هما في الغار إذ يقول لصاحبه لا تحزن إن الله معنا فأنزل الله سكينته عليه وأيده بجنود لم تروها وجعل كلمة الذين كفروا السفلى وكلمة الله هي العليا والله عزيز حكيم
1275,9,41,"Enlist, light and heavy, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah. That is better for you, if you only knew.","This verse encourages Muslims to participate in jihad (struggle) for the cause of Allah with all their resources, whether they are physically capable or not. It emphasizes the importance of striving with one's wealth and life in the path of Allah, as this is beneficial for the believers if they truly understand the reward and virtue in it.",انفروا خفافا وثقالا وجاهدوا بأموالكم وأنفسكم في سبيل الله ذلكم خير لكم إن كنتم تعلمون
1276,9,42,"If it had been a near gain and a short journey, they would have followed you; but the distance was too great for them. Yet they will swear by Allah, 'If we had been able, we would have gone forth with you,' destroying themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.","Allah is describing the hypocrites who make excuses not to join the Prophet in battle. If the gain was easy and the journey short, they would have joined. But since the journey was long and difficult, they made false oaths that they would have joined if they could, when in reality they are lying and have no intention of sacrificing for the cause of Allah.",لو كان عرضا قريبا وسفرا قاصدا لاتبعوك ولكن بعدت عليهم الشقة وسيحلفون بالله لو استطعنا لخرجنا معكم يهلكون أنفسهم والله يعلم إنهم لكاذبون
1277,9,43,"May Allah pardon you, [O Muhammad]. Why did you give them permission [to remain behind] until became evident to you who were truthful and you knew [who were] the liars?",This verse is addressing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding an incident where he excused some people from participating in a battle without verifying their claims. The interpretation is that Allah is forgiving the Prophet for granting permission to those who claimed to have excuses without thoroughly investigating the truthfulness of their claims. It serves as a lesson to distinguish between the truthful and the liars before making such decisions.,عفا الله عنك لم أذنت لهم حتى يتبين لك الذين صدقوا وتعلم الكاذبين
1278,9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day would not ask your permission to strive with their wealth and their lives. And Allah is All-Aware of those who have Taqwa (piety).,"This verse emphasizes the strong faith and commitment of true believers. They do not seek permission to make sacrifices and strive in Allah's cause with their wealth and lives, for they are driven by their unwavering belief in Allah and the Day of Judgment. Their actions stem from a deep sense of piety and consciousness of Allah, who is fully aware of those who possess Taqwa.",لا يستأذنك الذين يؤمنون بالله واليوم الآخر أن يجاهدوا بأموالهم وأنفسهم والله عليم بالمتقين
1279,9,45,"Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask your permission [O Muhammad], while their hearts are in doubt, and they waver in their doubt.","This verse is referring to the hypocrites who outwardly claimed to be Muslim but inwardly harbored doubts and disbelief. They would make excuses and seek permission from the Prophet to be exempted from certain obligations, revealing their lack of true faith in Allah and the Day of Judgment. Their hearts were filled with doubt and uncertainty, causing them to vacillate in their state of doubt.",إنما يستأذنك الذين لا يؤمنون بالله واليوم الآخر وارتابت قلوبهم فهم في ريبهم يترددون
1280,9,46,"And if they had intended to go forth, they would have prepared for it some provision. But Allah disliked their being sent forth, so He made them linger, and it was said, ""Remain you with those who remain behind.""","This verse refers to the hypocrites who did not participate in the battle and claimed they would have gone if they were prepared. Allah exposed their insincerity by saying that if they truly intended to go, they would have made the necessary preparations. However, Allah did not want them to join the believers because their presence would have caused harm and discord. So Allah caused them to hesitate and remain behind with those who stayed back from the battle without a valid excuse.",ولو أرادوا الخروج لأعدوا له عدة ولكن كره الله انبعاثهم فثبطهم وقيل اقعدوا مع القاعدين
1281,9,47,"If they were to go forth among you, they would add to you nothing except trouble, and would hurry to and fro among you, seeking to cause sedition among you; and among you there are some who would listen to them. And Allah is Aware of the wrongdoers.","This verse warns the believers against hypocrites and their malicious intentions. It states that if the hypocrites were to participate in the affairs of the believers, they would only bring harm, mischief, and sedition. They would actively seek to create discord and disunity among the believers, exploiting those who are naive or weak in faith. However, Allah is fully aware of those who spread corruption and act unjustly.",لو خرجوا فيكم ما زادوكم إلا خبالا ولأوضعوا خلالكم يبغونكم الفتنة وفيكم سماعون لهم والله عليم بالظالمين
1282,9,48,"They had sought [to cause] dissension before and had upset matters for you until the truth came and the command of Allah became evident, while they were averse.","This verse refers to the disbelievers and hypocrites who tried to create discord and turmoil among the Muslims. They stirred up troubles and spread rumors to undermine the faith and unity of the believers. However, their plots failed as the truth became manifest, and Allah's command prevailed despite their aversion and opposition.",لقد ابتغوا الفتنة من قبل وقلبوا لك الأمور حتى جاء الحق وظهر أمر الله وهم كارهون
1283,9,49,"And among them is he who says, ""Permit me and do not put me to trial."" Unquestionably, they have fallen into trial. And indeed, Hellfire will encompass the disbelievers.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who asked to be excused from participating in jihad, fearing that they would be tempted by the worldly gains of war and thus expose their true lack of faith. However, by seeking exemption, they have already fallen into a trial of their faith. The verse warns that Hellfire awaits those who disbelieve and reject the call to defend the religion.",ومنهم من يقول ائذن لي ولا تفتني ألا في الفتنة سقطوا وإن جهنم لمحيطة بالكافرين
1284,9,50,"If good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you, they say, 'We took our matter in advance' and turn away while they are rejoicing.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who are displeased when the believers attain any good or blessing, and rejoice and become arrogant when the believers face any harm or difficulty. It exposes their malicious attitude and lack of sincerity towards the believers.",إن تصبك حسنة تسؤهم وإن تصبك مصيبة يقولوا قد أخذنا أمرنا من قبل ويتولوا وهم فرحون
1285,9,51,"Say, 'Never will we be struck except by what Allah has decreed for us; He is our protector.' And upon Allah let the believers put their trust.","This verse emphasizes the belief in divine decree (qadar) and encourages the believers to have complete trust in Allah. It teaches that whatever happens to us, good or bad, is predetermined by Allah's will and wisdom. Our role is to accept it with patience and faith, and to rely solely on Allah for protection and guidance. The verse instills a sense of contentment and submission to the divine plan, while motivating the believers to strengthen their trust and dependence on their Lord.",قل لن يصيبنا إلا ما كتب الله لنا هو مولانا وعلى الله فليتوكل المؤمنون
1286,9,52,"Say, ""Do you await for us except one of the two best things [i.e., martyrdom or victory], while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So await; indeed we, along with you, are awaiting.""","This verse commands the Prophet Muhammad to tell the disbelievers that the believers are awaiting one of the two best outcomes: either martyrdom in the cause of Allah, which will lead to eternal bliss in Paradise, or victory over their enemies. On the other hand, the disbelievers should expect punishment from Allah or at the hands of the believers. The verse emphasizes that both parties are waiting and watching, but the believers are prepared for either outcome while hoping for Allah's aid and victory.",قل هل تربصون بنا إلا إحدى الحسنيين ونحن نتربص بكم أن يصيبكم الله بعذاب من عنده أو بأيدينا فتربصوا إنا معكم متربصون
1287,9,53,"Say: 'Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Indeed, you have been a defiantly disobedient people.'","This verse emphasizes that true faith and obedience to God must come from a sincere heart, not out of compulsion or mere formality. Charitable spending or any other act of worship done unwillingly or grudgingly will not be accepted by God, as He looks at the intentions behind actions. The verse is addressing those who lacked true faith and were rebellious against God's commands.",قل أنفقوا طوعا أو كرها لن يتقبل منكم إنكم كنتم قوما فاسقين
1288,9,54,And what prevented their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger and they did not approach prayer except while they were lazy and they did not spend except while they were unwilling.,"This verse explains the reasons why the expenditures and good deeds of some people are not accepted by Allah. It is because they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, they perform prayers lazily without devotion, and they spend in charity unwillingly and grudgingly. True faith, sincerity, and willingness are essential for one's deeds to be accepted by Allah.",وما منعهم أن تقبل منهم نفقاتهم إلا أنهم كفروا بالله وبرسوله ولا يأتون الصلاة إلا وهم كسالى ولا ينفقون إلا وهم كارهون
1289,9,55,"So let not their wealth or their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world, and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.","The interpretation is that Allah is warning the believers not to be impressed or misled by the wealth and children of the disbelievers. These worldly possessions are temporary and will ultimately lead to their punishment in this life and the Hereafter. The disbelievers' souls will depart in a state of disbelief, which is the greatest loss.",فلا تعجبك أموالهم ولا أولادهم إنما يريد الله ليعذبهم بها في الحياة الدنيا وتزهق أنفسهم وهم كافرون
1290,9,56,"And they swear by Allah that they are truly of you, yet they are not of you, but they are people who are ever apprehensive.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly claimed to be Muslims but inwardly harbored disbelief and enmity towards the believers. They would swear by Allah that they were part of the Muslim community, but their actions betrayed their true nature. They were in a state of constant fear and apprehension, unable to fully commit to either belief or disbelief.",ويحلفون بالله إنهم لمنكم وما هم منكم ولكنهم قوم يفرقون
1291,9,57,"If they could find a refuge or some caves or even a crevice, they would turn towards it, still overflowing with rage.","This verse refers to the arrogant and obstinate disbelievers who reject the truth. It implies that if they had any opportunity to escape from the truth, such as finding a refuge, cave, or crevice, they would rush towards it while still being in a state of rage and stubbornness. Their rejection of the truth is not due to a lack of understanding, but rather a result of their arrogance and unwillingness to accept it.",لو يجدون ملجأ أو مغارات أو مدخلا لولوا إليه وهم يجمحون
1292,9,58,"And among them are those who criticize you concerning the [distribution of] charities. If they are given from them, they approve; but if they are not given from them, at once they become enraged.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who were critical of how the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) distributed charity and zakat (obligatory alms). If they received a share, they were pleased, but if they did not receive anything, they became displeased and angry. This exposes their greed and lack of sincere faith, as they were more concerned with worldly gains than pleasing Allah.",ومنهم من يلمزك في الصدقات فإن أعطوا منها رضوا وإن لم يعطوا منها إذا هم يسخطون
1293,9,59,"But if only they had been satisfied with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and had said, 'Sufficient for us is Allah; Allah will give us of His bounty, and [so will] His Messenger; to Allah we humbly turn our hopes,'","This verse criticizes the greed and dissatisfaction of some people who were not content with what Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had given them. It encourages people to be satisfied with what they have been granted, trust in Allah's provision, and turn to Him with hope and humility, rather than being consumed by greed and worldly desires.",ولو أنهم رضوا ما آتاهم الله ورسوله وقالوا حسبنا الله سيؤتينا الله من فضله ورسوله إنا إلى الله راغبون
1294,9,60,"Indeed, the charities are only for the poor and the needy, and those who work on [collecting] them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and for [freeing] those in bondage, and for the debt-ridden, and in the cause of Allah, and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.","This verse outlines the categories of people who are entitled to receive zakat (obligatory charity). It emphasizes that zakat is a religious obligation prescribed by Allah, and its distribution should be carried out with wisdom and knowledge. The verse highlights the importance of supporting the less fortunate, reconciling hearts to Islam, freeing captives, assisting those in debt, funding efforts in the cause of Allah, and helping stranded travelers.",إنما الصدقات للفقراء والمساكين والعاملين عليها والمؤلفة قلوبهم وفي الرقاب والغارمين وفي سبيل الله وابن السبيل فريضة من الله والله عليم حكيم
1295,9,61,"And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, 'He is all ear.' Say, 'He listens to what is best for you; he believes in Allah and has faith in the believers; and he is a mercy for those of you who believe.' But those who abuse the Messenger of Allah will have a painful punishment.","This verse addresses the mockery of some hypocrites towards the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. They claimed he was gullible and would believe anything said to him. However, the Qur'an affirms that the Prophet only listens to what is beneficial and has faith in Allah and the believers. He is a mercy for the true believers. Those who insult the Prophet will face a severe punishment for their disrespect.",ومنهم الذين يؤذون النبي ويقولون هو أذن قل أذن خير لكم يؤمن بالله ويؤمن للمؤمنين ورحمة للذين آمنوا منكم والذين يؤذون رسول الله لهم عذاب أليم

That is the great disgrace.",This verse warns those who defy Allah and reject His Messenger that they will be punished with the eternal torment of Hellfire. It emphasizes the grave consequence of opposing the truth and highlights the disgraceful state of those who persist in disbelief and disobedience to Allah and His Messenger.,ألم يعلموا أنه من يحادد الله ورسوله فأن له نار جهنم خالدا فيها ذلك الخزي العظيم
1298,9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a surah be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, ""Mock [as you wish]; indeed, Allah will expose that which you fear.""","This verse warns the hypocrites, those who outwardly professed faith but inwardly harbored disbelief and ill intentions towards the Prophet and the Muslim community. They feared that a chapter of the Qur'an would expose the reality of their hearts, revealing their true motives and doubts. The verse instructs the Prophet to tell them to mock and ridicule as they wish, for Allah will inevitably bring to light the very things they fear being exposed, their hypocrisy and hidden disbelief.",يحذر المنافقون أن تنزل عليهم سورة تنبئهم بما في قلوبهم قل استهزئوا إن الله مخرج ما تحذرون
1299,9,65,"And if you ask them, they will surely say, 'We were only conversing and playing.' Say, 'Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?'","This verse condemns the mocking attitude of the disbelievers towards the teachings of Islam and the Messenger. They would claim that they were just joking or playing around, but the Qur'an asserts that mocking Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger is a grave sin that should not be taken lightly.

Indeed, the hypocrites - it is they who are the defiantly disobedient.","This verse describes the characteristics and behavior of hypocrites (munafiqun). They encourage each other to do evil deeds and prevent righteousness. They are miserly and withhold spending in the way of Allah. By forgetting Allah's commands, they have been forsaken by Him.

Ils ont profité de leurs biens terrestres pendant un certain temps, tout comme les incroyants actuels en profitent.

They swore falsely that they did not utter words of disbelief, but in reality they had spoken such words after pretending to accept Islam. They intended to act against the Prophet ﷺ and the believers, but were unable to achieve their malicious goals. Their resentment stemmed from the fact that Allah had enriched the Prophet ﷺ and the believers with His bounties.

1314,9,80,"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them - even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times - never will Allah forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.","This verse indicates that Allah will not forgive those who disbelieved in Him and His Messenger, even if the Prophet Muhammad asked for forgiveness for them seventy times. Their disbelief and defiance against Allah and His Messenger has made them ineligible for Allah's forgiveness and guidance.

Their lack of commitment to the cause and their desire to remain with those who stayed behind and avoided striving exposed their hypocrisy and weakness of faith.",وإذا أنزلت سورة أن آمنوا بالله وجاهدوا مع رسوله استأذنك أولو الطول منهم وقالوا ذرنا نكن مع القاعدين

It highlights that they should not be blamed or criticized for turning back when the Prophet did not have means to provide for their participation. Their tears of sadness upon being unable to contribute reflect their sincere desire to support the cause, despite their limited means.",ولا على الذين إذا ما أتوك لتحملهم قلت لا أجد ما أحملكم عليه تولوا وأعينهم تفيض من الدمع حزنا ألا يجدوا ما ينفقون

Yet they do not repent, nor do they take heed.","This verse is a rhetorical question posed to those who persist in disbelief and sin, despite the trials and afflictions they face in life. It suggests that these trials should serve as reminders and opportunities for them to repent and turn back to God, but instead, they remain heedless and unrepentant. The repetition of trials is meant to awaken their consciousness and guide them towards the right path, but their stubborn rejection of faith and lack of remorse indicates their spiritual blindness and unwillingness to learn from their experiences.",أولا يرون أنهم يفتنون في كل عام مرة أو مرتين ثم لا يتوبون ولا هم يذكرون
1361,9,127,"And when a surah is revealed, some of them look at one another: 'Does anyone see you?' Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not comprehend.","This verse criticizes the hypocrites who, when a new chapter of the Qur'an was revealed, would look around suspiciously to see if anyone was watching them. They then turned away from listening to or heeding the revelation, as Allah has turned their hearts away from guidance due to their lack of understanding and unwillingness to accept the truth.",وإذا ما أنزلت سورة نظر بعضهم إلى بعض هل يراكم من أحد ثم انصرفوا صرف الله قلوبهم بأنهم قوم لا يفقهون
1362,9,128,There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.,"This verse highlights the compassionate and caring nature of the Prophet Muhammad towards his people. He was one of them, deeply concerned about their difficulties and sufferings. He was eager to guide them to the right path and alleviate their burdens. The verse emphasizes his kindness and mercy towards the believers, treating them with gentleness and compassion.",لقد جاءكم رسول من أنفسكم عزيز عليه ما عنتم حريص عليكم بالمؤمنين رءوف رحيم
1363,9,129,"But if they turn away, then say, 'Sufficient for me is Allah; there is no deity except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.'","If the disbelievers persist in their rejection and turn away from the truth, then put your trust in Allah alone, for He is the only true God worthy of worship and reliance. Declare that Allah is sufficient for you, and place your complete trust and reliance in Him, for He is the Lord and Sustainer of the mighty Throne, which symbolizes His supreme authority and control over all creation.",فإن تولوا فقل حسبي الله لا إله إلا هو عليه توكلت وهو رب العرش العظيم
1364,10,1,Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the wise Book.,"This verse consists of three Arabic letters - Alif, Lam, and Ra - known as the 'Muqatta'aat' or 'disjointed letters.' These letters are believed to be a sign of the divine origin and inimitable nature of the Qur'an. The verse then affirms that the verses that follow are from the 'Wise Book,' referring to the Qur'an as a source of wisdom and guidance from Allah.",الر تلك آيات الكتاب الحكيم
1365,10,2,Is it a wonder for mankind that We have revealed to a man from among themselves (saying): 'Warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they shall have a firm standing with their Lord?' The disbelievers say: 'This is indeed an evident sorcerer.',"Allah is questioning the disbelievers' astonishment at the fact that He has chosen a man from among themselves, i.e., the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to receive revelation and warn people about the consequences of disbelief and give glad tidings to the believers of their elevated status with their Lord. The disbelievers, out of arrogance and stubbornness, dismiss the Prophet as an ""evident sorcerer,"" accusing him of deception and trickery.",أكان للناس عجبا أن أوحينا إلى رجل منهم أن أنذر الناس وبشر الذين آمنوا أن لهم قدم صدق عند ربهم قال الكافرون إن هذا لساحر مبين
1366,10,3,"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne, arranging the matter [of His creation]. There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Then will you not remember?","This verse affirms the Oneness of Allah as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It emphasizes that Allah alone is worthy of worship and obedience, as He is the sole source of guidance and authority. The reference to the ""six days"" of creation is symbolic, indicating the gradual and orderly nature of the creative process. The verse also highlights Allah's transcendence and sovereignty, as He is described as being established on the Throne, controlling and governing all affairs. It warns against associating any partners or intercessors with Allah without His permission, as that would contradict the principle of pure monotheism (Tawheed).",إن ربكم الله الذي خلق السماوات والأرض في ستة أيام ثم استوى على العرش يدبر الأمر ما من شفيع إلا من بعد إذنه ذلكم الله ربكم فاعبدوه أفلا تذكرون
1367,10,4,"To Him is your return all, truly Allah's promise; indeed, He begins the creation, then He will repeat it, that He may reward those who believed and did righteous deeds, in equity; but they who disbelieved, for them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve.","This verse affirms that the final return of all beings is to Allah on the Day of Resurrection. It emphasizes Allah's power to initiate creation and then repeat it after death. The believers who did good deeds will be justly rewarded, while the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment of drinking burning water as a consequence of their disbelief.",إليه مرجعكم جميعا وعد الله حقا إنه يبدأ الخلق ثم يعيده ليجزي الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات بالقسط والذين كفروا لهم شراب من حميم وعذاب أليم بما كانوا يكفرون

Allah has not created this except in truth. He details the signs for a people who know.,"Allah is highlighting His power and wisdom in the creation of the sun and moon, which serve as sources of light and markers for determining the passage of time. The phases of the moon help us calculate years and keep track of time. All of this is created with a purpose and wisdom, not in vain. These signs in the universe point to the existence and greatness of the Creator for those who reflect and understand.",هو الذي جعل الشمس ضياء والقمر نورا وقدره منازل لتعلموا عدد السنين والحساب ما خلق الله ذلك إلا بالحق يفصل الآيات لقوم يعلمون
1369,10,6,"Indeed, in the alternation of night and day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a people who are mindful.","This verse highlights the wonders and signs of Allah's creation in the alternation of night and day, and in the heavens and the earth. These signs serve as evidence of Allah's existence and power for those who have taqwa (mindfulness of Allah and consciousness of His commandments). The regular cycle of day and night, and the marvels in the heavens and earth, should lead people to reflect on the greatness of the Creator and submit to His will.",إن في اختلاف الليل والنهار وما خلق الله في السماوات والأرض لآيات لقوم يتقون
1370,10,7,"Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel reassured by it, and those who are heedless of Our signs,","This verse refers to those who have no faith in the Hereafter and the accountability before God. They are content with the temporary pleasures of this worldly life and feel secure in their disbelief. They are heedless of God's signs and revelations, ignoring the evidences that point to the truth of faith and the inevitability of the Day of Judgment.",إن الذين لا يرجون لقاءنا ورضوا بالحياة الدنيا واطمأنوا بها والذين هم عن آياتنا غافلون
1371,10,8,Those - their refuge is the Fire because of what they used to earn.,"This verse is warning about the dreadful consequence of disbelief and disobedience to Allah. It states that those who reject faith and engage in sinful deeds will have the Fire of Hell as their ultimate abode, as a result of their own misguided choices and evil actions in this world. The phrase ""because of what they used to earn"" indicates that they will be held accountable for their intentional rejection of truth and persistence in wrongdoing.",أولئك مأواهم النار بما كانوا يكسبون
1372,10,9,"Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Beneath them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure.","This verse promises guidance and eternal bliss in the Gardens of Paradise for those who have faith and perform righteous deeds. Their faith and good actions will lead them to be rightly guided by Allah, and they will be rewarded with rivers flowing beneath them in the everlasting Gardens of Delight.",إن الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات يهديهم ربهم بإيمانهم تجري من تحتهم الأنهار في جنات النعيم

And the last of their call will be, 'Praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds.'","This verse describes the state of the believers in Paradise. Their invocations and supplications will be filled with glorification of Allah, free from any imperfection or shortcoming. Their greetings will be of peace and security, devoid of any ill-will or animosity.

But We leave those who do not expect the meeting with Us wandering blindly in their transgression.","Allah does not hasten punishment for people as they hasten for good things in this world. If He did so, their term of life would end quickly. Instead, He gives them respite and delays their punishment. As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter and meeting Allah, We leave them wandering blindly in their transgression and misguidance.",ولو يعجل الله للناس الشر استعجالهم بالخير لقضي إليهم أجلهم فنذر الذين لا يرجون لقاءنا في طغيانهم يعمهون
1375,10,12,"And when adversity touches man, he calls upon Us, lying on his side or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his adversity from him, he passes on as if he had never called upon Us for an adversity that touched him. Thus is made fair-seeming to the prodigals that which they used to do.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and heedlessness of human beings. When afflicted with hardship, they earnestly supplicate to Allah. But once the difficulty is removed, they become arrogant and ungrateful, behaving as if they had never prayed for relief. This attitude of taking Allah's favors for granted and persisting in sinful ways is censured as a quality of the wasteful and extravagant.",وإذا مس الإنسان الضر دعانا لجنبه أو قاعدا أو قائما فلما كشفنا عنه ضره مر كأن لم يدعنا إلى ضر مسه كذلك زين للمسرفين ما كانوا يعملون

Thus do We recompense the criminal people.","""Allah is stating that He has destroyed previous nations who persisted in wrongdoing and disbelief despite receiving clear signs and messengers from Him. This was a punishment for their crimes and stubborn rejection of faith. Similarly, Allah warns that He will hold accountable those who commit sins and reject the truth.""",ولقد أهلكنا القرون من قبلكم لما ظلموا وجاءتهم رسلهم بالبينات وما كانوا ليؤمنوا كذلك نجزي القوم المجرمين
1377,10,14,Then We made you successors in the land after them so that We may observe how you would act.,"This verse indicates that Allah has made human beings the successors or inheritors of the earth after the previous nations. It implies that humans have been given a privileged position on earth, but with this privilege comes responsibility. Allah is observing how humans conduct themselves and utilize the resources of the earth. This serves as a reminder that people will be held accountable for their actions and how they fulfill the role of being Allah's representatives on earth.",ثم جعلناكم خلائف في الأرض من بعدهم لننظر كيف تعملون
1378,10,15,"And when Our clear verses are recited to them, those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, 'Bring a Qur'an other than this or change it.' Say, 'It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. If I were to disobey my Lord, I would fear the punishment of a tremendous Day.'",هذه الآية تتحدث عن رفض الكافرين للقرآن الكريم، حيث طلبوا من النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يأتي بقرآن آخر غير هذا القرآن أو يغيره. ولكن الله أمر نبيه أن يرد عليهم بأنه لا يستطيع تغيير القرآن من تلقاء نفسه، وإنما يتبع ما يوحى إليه من ربه، وأنه إن عصى ربه فإنه سيخاف عذاب يوم القيامة العظيم.,وإذا تتلى عليهم آياتنا بينات قال الذين لا يرجون لقاءنا ائت بقرآن غير هذا أو بدله قل ما يكون لي أن أبدله من تلقاء نفسي إن أتبع إلا ما يوحى إلي إني أخاف إن عصيت ربي عذاب يوم عظيم

Will you not then understand?'","This verse suggests that the Qur'an is a divine revelation from Allah, and the Prophet Muhammad did not have any prior knowledge of it before it was revealed to him. The verse implies that if Allah had not willed the Qur'an to be revealed, the Prophet would not have been able to recite it or make it known to the people, despite living among them for a long time before the revelation. It is a call for the people to use their intellect and realize the divine origin of the Qur'an.",قل لو شاء الله ما تلوته عليكم ولا أدراكم به فقد لبثت فيكم عمرا من قبله أفلا تعقلون
1380,10,17,"So who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or denies His verses? Indeed, the criminals will not succeed.","This verse condemns those who fabricate lies against Allah or reject His clear signs and revelations. It emphasizes that such individuals are engaging in a grave injustice and wrongdoing. The verse warns that those who commit such crimes and persist in disbelief and falsehood will ultimately fail and not attain success or salvation. Their actions are a manifestation of their criminal nature, and they will face the consequences of their misdeeds.",فمن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أو كذب بآياته إنه لا يفلح المجرمون

Say: 'Do you inform Allah of something He knows not in the heavens or on the earth?' Glorified and Exalted is He above all that they associate as partners with Him!","This verse condemns the practice of worshipping idols or false deities besides Allah, as they can neither harm nor benefit anyone. It criticizes those who claim that these idols will intercede for them before Allah, questioning how they can attribute knowledge to Allah that He does not possess. The verse declares Allah to be far above and exalted from all that they associate as partners with Him.",ويعبدون من دون الله ما لا يضرهم ولا ينفعهم ويقولون هؤلاء شفعاؤنا عند الله قل أتنبئون الله بما لا يعلم في السماوات ولا في الأرض سبحانه وتعالى عما يشركون

And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them [immediately] concerning that over which they differed.","Allah is stating that initially all of humanity was upon one religion and belief system, worshipping Allah alone. However, differences arose among them as some people deviated from the truth. Had it not been for Allah's wisdom and plan to allow people to live with their different beliefs until an appointed time, He would have judged between them immediately regarding the matters over which they differed.",وما كان الناس إلا أمة واحدة فاختلفوا ولولا كلمة سبقت من ربك لقضي بينهم فيما فيه يختلفون

Say, 'The unseen belongs to Allah, so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.'","The disbelievers demanded a miraculous sign from the Prophet to prove his prophethood. The interpretation is that Allah instructs the Prophet to respond that only Allah has knowledge of the unseen and when miracles will occur. The Prophet is told to be patient and wait along with the believers, as the truth will eventually become evident.",ويقولون لولا أنزل عليه آية من ربه فقل إنما الغيب لله فانتظروا إني معكم من المنتظرين

Indeed, Our messengers record what you devise.""","This verse implies that when Allah bestows His mercy and blessings upon people after they have faced difficulties, some of them become arrogant and ungrateful. They start to doubt and reject Allah's signs and revelations. The verse instructs the Prophet to tell such people that Allah is the swiftest in planning and devising, and that His messengers record all their evil plots and schemes, which will be held against them on the Day of Judgment.",وإذا أذقنا الناس رحمة من بعد ضراء مستهم إذا لهم مكر في آياتنا قل الله أسرع مكرا إن رسلنا يكتبون ما تمكرون

Then there strikes them a storm wind, and the waves come upon them from everywhere, and they think that they are surrounded by them. Then they supplicate Allah, being sincere to Him in religion [saying], 'If You should save us from this, we will surely be among the thankful.'","Allah contrôle les mouvements des navires sur la mer. Lorsque les conditions sont favorables, les gens se réjouissent. Mais lorsqu'une tempête survient et que les vagues les menacent de tous côtés, ils se tournent sincèrement vers Allah et Lui promettent d'être reconnaissants s'Il les sauve. Cela montre que l'être humain a tendance à oublier Allah dans les bons moments et à se tourner vers Lui dans les moments difficiles.",هو الذي يسيركم في البر والبحر حتى إذا كنتم في الفلك وجرين بهم بريح طيبة وفرحوا بها جاءتها ريح عاصف وجاءهم الموج من كل مكان وظنوا أنهم أحيط بهم دعوا الله مخلصين له الدين لئن أنجيتنا من هذه لنكونن من الشاكرين

O mankind, your insolence is only against yourselves - an enjoyment of worldly life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.","Allah is criticizing those who, when saved from hardship, become arrogant and ungrateful, transgressing against His commands. He reminds them that their arrogance and disobedience only harms themselves, as it deprives them of eternal bliss. Their enjoyment of this worldly life is temporary, and they will ultimately return to Allah, who will hold them accountable for their actions.",فلما أنجاهم إذا هم يبغون في الأرض بغير الحق يا أيها الناس إنما بغيكم على أنفسكم متاع الحياة الدنيا ثم إلينا مرجعكم فننبئكم بما كنتم تعملون
1387,10,24,"The example of the life of this world is but like rain water which We have sent down from the sky, and which the vegetation of the earth has mingled with it, from which men and cattle eat until, when the earth has taken on its ornaments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, and We make it a harvest clean-mown, as though it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for a people who reflect.","This verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the transient and temporary nature of this worldly life. It compares the life of this world to rain water that falls from the sky, causing plants to grow and flourish, providing sustenance for humans and animals. However, this flourishing is short-lived, as when the earth reaches its peak beauty and people think they have control over it, Allah's command comes suddenly, like at night or during the day, and the vegetation is cut down and harvested, as if it had never existed before. This metaphor teaches us that the pleasures and possessions of this world are fleeting and temporary, and that we should not become attached to them or think that we have complete control over them. Instead, we should reflect on the signs of Allah and focus on the everlasting life of the Hereafter.",إنما مثل الحياة الدنيا كماء أنزلناه من السماء فاختلط به نبات الأرض مما يأكل الناس والأنعام حتى إذا أخذت الأرض زخرفها وازينت وظن أهلها أنهم قادرون عليها أتاها أمرنا ليلا أو نهارا فجعلناها حصيدا كأن لم تغن بالأمس كذلك نفصل الآيات لقوم يتفكرون
1388,10,25,And Allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whom He wills to a straight path.,"Allah invites all people to enter Islam, which is the path that leads to peace, security, and contentment in this life and the Hereafter. He guides whomever He wills to the straight path of truth and righteousness, which is the only way to attain salvation and eternal bliss.",والله يدعو إلى دار السلام ويهدي من يشاء إلى صراط مستقيم
1389,10,26,For those who have done good is the best reward and extra. No darkness or disgrace shall cover their faces. They are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.,"This verse promises a great reward for the righteous believers. The ""best"" refers to the highest level of Paradise, and the ""extra"" implies additional favors from Allah. Their faces will be radiant, showing no anger, sadness, or humiliation. They will dwell eternally in Paradise, which is the ultimate success.",للذين أحسنوا الحسنى وزيادة ولا يرهق وجوههم قتر ولا ذلة أولئك أصحاب الجنة هم فيها خالدون
1390,10,27,"But those who have earned evil deeds - the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliating disgrace will cover them. They will have from Allah no protector. It is as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark [are they]. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","This verse describes the punishment for those who commit evil deeds. Their recompense will be an equivalent evil punishment, and they will be covered in humiliating disgrace with no one to protect them from Allah's punishment. Their state is likened to having their faces covered by the darkness of the night, indicating their spiritual blindness. Such people are the dwellers of Hellfire, where they will abide forever.",والذين كسبوا السيئات جزاء سيئة بمثلها وترهقهم ذلة ما لهم من الله من عاصم كأنما أغشيت وجوههم قطعا من الليل مظلما أولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون

Then We will separate them, and their 'partners' will say, ""You did not used to worship us""","On the Day of Judgment, Allah will gather all people and their claimed partners or idols they associated with Allah. Allah will command the idolaters to remain in their place along with their claimed partners. Then Allah will separate the idolaters from their partners. The partners will declare that the idolaters were not truly worshipping them, rather they were worshipping their own desires and misconceptions.",ويوم نحشرهم جميعا ثم نقول للذين أشركوا مكانكم أنتم وشركاؤكم فزيلنا بينهم وقال شركاؤهم ما كنتم إيانا تعبدون
1392,10,29,But sufficient is Allah as a witness between us and you that we were unaware of your worship.,"This verse emphasizes that Allah is the ultimate witness and judge between the believers and the disbelievers. It suggests that the believers were oblivious to the polytheistic practices of the disbelievers, and they did not participate in their false worship. The verse affirms the believers"" trust in Allah as the sole witness and arbiter, rejecting the need for any other witness or judge.",فكفى بالله شهيدا بيننا وبينكم إن كنا عن عبادتكم لغافلين
1393,10,30,"There every soul will be put to trial for what it had earned, and they will be returned to Allah, their true Lord, and whatever they used to fabricate will be lost from them.","This verse emphasizes the accountability of every soul on the Day of Judgment. Each person will be tested and held responsible for their past deeds and actions. They will return to Allah, their true Lord and Creator, leaving behind all the false beliefs and fabrications they followed in this worldly life. The interpretation highlights the concepts of individual responsibility, Divine justice, and the ultimate reality of returning to Allah while abandoning falsehoods.",هنالك تبلو كل نفس ما أسلفت وردوا إلى الله مولاهم الحق وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون
1394,10,31,"Say, 'Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who arranges every matter?' They will say, 'Allah.' Say, 'Then will you not fear Him?'","This verse highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty and control over all aspects of creation. It calls upon people to reflect on the signs of Allah's power and wisdom manifested in the sustenance they receive, their ability to hear and see, the cycle of life and death, and the perfect order governing the universe. By recognizing Allah as the sole provider and sustainer, the verse exhorts people to have taqwa (reverence and consciousness) of Him.",قل من يرزقكم من السماء والأرض أمن يملك السمع والأبصار ومن يخرج الحي من الميت ويخرج الميت من الحي ومن يدبر الأمر فسيقولون الله فقل أفلا تتقون
1395,10,32,"So this is Allah, your true Lord. And what is there after truth except error? So how are you averted?",This verse affirms that Allah is the true Lord and the only deity worthy of worship. It then questions what could be sought after the truth except misguidance and falsehood. The verse is calling people to reflect on the reality of Allah's Lordship and to avoid being misled away from the straight path after the truth has become evident to them.,فذلكم الله ربكم الحق فماذا بعد الحق إلا الضلال فأنى تصرفون
1396,10,33,Thus the Word of your Lord is justified against those who defiantly disobeyed that they will not believe.,"This verse emphasizes the inevitability of Allah's punishment for those who persist in disbelief and disobedience. Their rejection of faith is a consequence of their own choices and actions, which ultimately lead them to be deprived of guidance and sealing their disbelief. Allah's decree is fulfilled, and His warning proves true for those who ""defiantly disobeyed"" and stubbornly refused to believe.",كذلك حقت كلمت ربك على الذين فسقوا أنهم لا يؤمنون
1397,10,34,"Say, ""Is there among your 'partners' any who begins creation and then repeats it?"" Say, ""Allah begins creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?""","This verse emphasizes the uniqueness of Allah as the sole Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It challenges the polytheists to identify any of their alleged partners with Allah who can initiate creation and then repeat it, as Allah does. The rhetorical question highlights the absurdity of associating partners with Allah, who alone has the power to originate and regenerate creation. The verse aims to dispel any confusion or delusion about the oneness of Allah in His creative abilities.",قل هل من شركائكم من يبدأ الخلق ثم يعيده قل الله يبدأ الخلق ثم يعيده فأنى تؤفكون
1398,10,35,"Say, 'Is there any among your associates who guides to the truth?' Say, 'Allah guides to the truth. So is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided? Then what is the matter with you? How do you judge?'","This verse emphasizes that only Allah has the true guidance and is worthy of being followed. It questions the idolaters who follow false deities that cannot guide them to the truth. The verse asserts that Allah alone guides to the truth, and questions why one would follow those who cannot guide themselves unless they are guided by Allah. It calls upon the idolaters to reflect on their judgment and reasoning.",قل هل من شركائكم من يهدي إلى الحق قل الله يهدي للحق أفمن يهدي إلى الحق أحق أن يتبع أمن لا يهدي إلا أن يهدى فما لكم كيف تحكمون
1399,10,36,"But most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Surely, conjecture avails nothing against the truth. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.","This verse emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and truth, rather than relying on mere assumptions or guesswork. It warns against following conjecture or unsubstantiated opinions, as they hold no weight against the absolute truth revealed by Allah. The verse asserts that Allah is fully aware of people's actions and intentions, reminding us to be mindful of our deeds and strive for knowledge and understanding based on divine guidance.",وما يتبع أكثرهم إلا ظنا إن الظن لا يغني من الحق شيئا إن الله عليم بما يفعلون
1400,10,37,"And this Qur'an could not have been fabricated by anyone besides Allah, but it is a confirmation of what came before it and an explanation of the Book in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds.","This verse emphasizes the divine origin of the Qur'an and its role in confirming and elaborating upon previous revelations. It rejects the notion that the Qur'an could have been fabricated by anyone other than Allah, as it is a continuation and affirmation of the truth revealed in earlier scriptures. The Qur'an provides a detailed explanation of the divine teachings, leaving no room for doubt about its source being the Lord of all creation.",وما كان هذا القرآن أن يفترى من دون الله ولكن تصديق الذي بين يديه وتفصيل الكتاب لا ريب فيه من رب العالمين
1401,10,38,"Or do they say, ""He has invented it""? Say, ""Then bring a surah like it and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.""","Allah challenges those who accuse the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of fabricating the Qur'an to produce something similar to it. Since the Qur'an is the inimitable Word of God, no human can compose anything like it, even if they seek help from all others besides Allah. This verse establishes the divine origin of the Qur'an and its miraculous nature.",أم يقولون افتراه قل فأتوا بسورة مثله وادعوا من استطعتم من دون الله إن كنتم صادقين
1402,10,39,"Nay, but they denied that the knowledge whereof they could not compass and whereof the interpretation (in relation to the future) has not yet come unto them, even so did those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the deniers!","This verse refers to the disbelievers who rejected the Qur'an and its teachings because they could not fully comprehend its knowledge and meaning. They denied it without understanding its true interpretation and deeper wisdom. This is similar to how previous nations also denied the truth that came to them from Allah. The verse warns that those who deny the truth will face the same consequences as previous deniers, implying punishment and destruction.",بل كذبوا بما لم يحيطوا بعلمه ولما يأتهم تأويله كذلك كذب الذين من قبلهم فانظر كيف كان عاقبة الظالمين
1403,10,40,"And among them are those who believe in it, and among them are those who do not believe in it. And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters.","This verse indicates that people have different responses to the divine message. Some embrace it with faith, while others reject it. Ultimately, God is fully aware of those who spread corruption and deviate from the truth.",ومنهم من يؤمن به ومنهم من لا يؤمن به وربك أعلم بالمفسدين
1404,10,41,"And if they deny you, then say, 'For me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds. You are disassociated from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do.'","This verse emphasizes individual accountability before God. It instructs the Prophet Muhammad to tell the disbelievers that he is not responsible for their actions, just as they are not responsible for his. Each person will be judged based on their own deeds, and no one can bear the burden of another's sins. The verse promotes religious tolerance and freedom of belief, while affirming that ultimate judgment rests with God alone.",وإن كذبوك فقل لي عملي ولكم عملكم أنتم بريئون مما أعمل وأنا بريء مما تعملون
1405,10,42,"And among them are those who listen to you, but can you cause the deaf to hear, although they will not use reason?","This verse is addressing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the disbelievers who refuse to listen to the message of Islam despite being presented with clear evidence and proofs. It rhetorically questions whether the Prophet can make the deaf, who are unwilling to use their intellect and reason, hear and understand the truth. The interpretation is that no matter how convincing the message is presented, those who stubbornly reject it and refuse to use their faculty of reason will not benefit from it.",ومنهم من يستمعون إليك أفأنت تسمع الصم ولو كانوا لا يعقلون
1406,10,43,"And among them is he who looks at you, but can you guide the blind although they will not [attempt to] see?","This verse is addressing the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and refers to the disbelievers who were unwilling to accept the truth, despite witnessing the clear signs and proofs presented to them. It emphasizes that true guidance comes from Allah, and no matter how clear the message is conveyed, those who deliberately choose to remain blind to the truth cannot be guided. The verse teaches that faith is a matter of personal choice and sincere willingness to accept the truth.",ومنهم من ينظر إليك أفأنت تهدي العمي ولو كانوا لا يبصرون
1407,10,44,"Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people at all, but it is the people who wrong themselves.","This verse emphasizes that Allah does not oppress or wrong anyone. Rather, it is human beings themselves who oppress and wrong their own souls through their disbelief, disobedience, and sins. Allah is perfectly Just and does not treat anyone unjustly or deprive them of their due rights. Any harm or misfortune that befalls people is a result of their own actions and choices, not due to any injustice or wrongdoing from Allah.",إن الله لا يظلم الناس شيئا ولكن الناس أنفسهم يظلمون
1408,10,45,"And on the Day when He will gather them together, it will appear to them as if they had not remained [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and they will] recognize each other. Those will have certainly lost who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided.","This verse describes the scene on the Day of Resurrection when all people will be gathered together. To them, it will seem as if they had lived in this world only for a short period of time, like an hour of a day. They will recognize one another, but those who denied the meeting with Allah and rejected His guidance will have lost everything and suffered a great loss.",ويوم يحشرهم كأن لم يلبثوا إلا ساعة من النهار يتعارفون بينهم قد خسر الذين كذبوا بلقاء الله وما كانوا مهتدين
1409,10,46,"And whether We show you part of what We have promised them or take you away [in death], upon you is only the [duty of] notification, and upon Us is the account.","This verse implies that whether the Prophet Muhammad sees the punishment of the disbelievers in this life or not, his duty is only to convey the message of Islam. The ultimate accountability and judgment of people's deeds lie with Allah. The Prophet's role is to guide and warn, while Allah is the witness over people's actions and will hold them accountable on the Day of Judgment.",وإما نرينك بعض الذي نعدهم أو نتوفينك فإلينا مرجعهم ثم الله شهيد على ما يفعلون
1410,10,47,"And for every nation there is a messenger. And when their messenger comes, it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged.","This verse affirms the universal principle of God sending messengers to every nation to guide them. When the messenger comes to a people, he judges between them fairly and with justice, without any oppression or wrongdoing towards them.",ولكل أمة رسول فإذا جاء رسولهم قضي بينهم بالقسط وهم لا يظلمون
1411,10,48,"And they say, 'When is this promise, if you should be truthful?'","This verse refers to the disbelievers mocking and questioning the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the believers about the promised punishment or the Day of Resurrection. They are demanding proof and challenging the truthfulness of the Prophet's message, implying that they do not believe in the warnings of a final reckoning or divine judgment.",ويقولون متى هذا الوعد إن كنتم صادقين
1412,10,49,"Say, 'I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except as Allah wills. For every nation is a [specified] term. When their time has come, they cannot delay it by a single hour, nor could they advance it.'","""This verse emphasizes the concept of complete submission to the will of Allah. It teaches that human beings have no independent power to benefit or harm themselves, and that everything happens according to Allah's will and decree. It also highlights the fact that each nation or community has a predetermined lifespan or term, and when that appointed time arrives, they cannot delay or hasten it even for a moment. This underscores the absolute sovereignty and power of Allah over all affairs.""",قل لا أملك لنفسي ضرا ولا نفعا إلا ما شاء الله لكل أمة أجل إذا جاء أجلهم فلا يستأخرون ساعة ولا يستقدمون
1413,10,50,"Say, ""Have you considered: if His punishment should come to you by night or by day - for which [aspect] of it would the criminals be impatient?""","This verse warns the disbelievers and criminals that Allah's punishment can come at any time, whether it is night or day. It questions which part of the punishment they would wish to hasten if it were to come upon them. The implication is that they should not be hasty in mocking the warnings, as the punishment is severe and inescapable when it arrives.",قل أرأيتم إن أتاكم عذابه بياتا أو نهارا ماذا يستعجل منه المجرمون
1414,10,51,Is it then the case that when it has actually occurred you will believe in it? [You slackers!] Though you were hastening it on before?,"This verse is a rebuke to those who denied the truth and mocked the warnings of punishment. They are being questioned about their disbelief even after witnessing the very thing they used to hasten and demand from the Prophet. It highlights their inconsistency and lack of faith, as they chose to believe only after the punishment had befallen them, whereas they should have believed from the beginning and heeded the warnings.",أثم إذا ما وقع آمنتم به آلآن وقد كنتم به تستعجلون
1415,10,52,"Then it will be said to those who did wrong, 'Taste the torment of eternity. Are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?'","This verse warns the wrongdoers and disbelievers that they will be punished eternally in the Hereafter for their misdeeds and rejection of faith. The phrase ""Taste the torment of eternity"" implies that they will suffer a prolonged and everlasting punishment. The rhetorical question ""Are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?"" emphasizes that their punishment is a direct consequence of their own actions and choices in this world. It highlights the principle of justice, where individuals are held accountable for their deeds and face the consequences accordingly.",ثم قيل للذين ظلموا ذوقوا عذاب الخلد هل تجزون إلا بما كنتم تكسبون
1416,10,53,"And they ask you, [O Muhammad], whether it is true. Say, ""Yes, by my Lord, indeed it is truth; and you will not cause failure [to Allah].""","This verse affirms the truthfulness of the Qur'an and the message of Islam. The interpretation is that the disbelievers used to question the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) about the truth of the revelation he received. Allah commanded him to affirm that it is indeed the truth from his Lord, and that they cannot escape or prevent the consequences of denying it.",ويستنبئونك أحق هو قل إي وربي إنه لحق وما أنتم بمعجزين
1417,10,54,"And if every soul that has wronged had everything on earth, it would offer it to ransom itself. They will confide their remorse when they see the punishment; and they will be judged with justice, and they will not be wronged.","This verse highlights the gravity of wrongdoing and the intense regret that wrongdoers will feel on the Day of Judgment. It emphasizes that even if they possessed all the wealth on earth, they would willingly offer it as a ransom to save themselves from the punishment. However, no ransom will be accepted on that Day. The verse also affirms that justice will be served, and no soul will be wronged in the final judgment.",ولو أن لكل نفس ظلمت ما في الأرض لافتدت به وأسروا الندامة لما رأوا العذاب وقضي بينهم بالقسط وهم لا يظلمون
1418,10,55,"Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Unquestionably, the promise of Allah is true, but most of them do not know.","This verse affirms that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone, and that His promise of resurrection, accountability and reward is true and inevitable. However, most people are heedless and ignorant of this reality.",ألا إن لله ما في السماوات والأرض ألا إن وعد الله حق ولكن أكثرهم لا يعلمون
1419,10,56,"It is He who gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.","This verse emphasizes the absolute power and sovereignty of Allah over all life and death. It affirms that Allah alone is the One who grants life and takes it away, and that ultimately all beings will return to Him for judgment and accountability. The verse highlights Allah's control over the cycle of creation and reminds us of our temporary existence in this world and our ultimate return to our Creator.",هو يحيي ويميت وإليه ترجعون
1420,10,57,"O mankind! There has come to you an exhortation from your Lord, a cure for what is in the hearts, a guidance and a mercy for the believers.","This verse addresses all of humanity, emphasizing that the Qur'an is a source of guidance, healing, and mercy specifically for the believers. It highlights the universal message of the Qur'an as a ""exhortation"" or advice from God that serves as a cure for the spiritual ailments and doubts in people's hearts. For those who have faith, the Qur'an provides clear guidance towards the right path and represents God's infinite mercy.",يا أيها الناس قد جاءتكم موعظة من ربكم وشفاء لما في الصدور وهدى ورحمة للمؤمنين
1421,10,58,"Say, 'In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate.'","This verse encourages believers to rejoice in Allah's favors and mercy upon them, as they are far better and more valuable than any worldly gains or wealth that people accumulate.

1422,10,59,"Say, 'Have you considered what provision Allah has sent down for you, and you have made some of it unlawful and some lawful?' Say, 'Has Allah permitted you, or do you fabricate lies against Allah?'","This verse questions the practice of making lawful what Allah has made unlawful, and vice versa, based on one's own whims and desires. It emphasizes that only Allah has the authority to legislate what is permissible and what is prohibited, and that attributing such authority to oneself is a grave lie against Allah.",قل أرأيتم ما أنزل الله لكم من رزق فجعلتم منه حراما وحلالا قل آلله أذن لكم أم على الله تفترون
1423,10,60,"And what think those who invent a lie against Allah of the Day of Resurrection? Verily, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.","This verse warns those who fabricate lies against Allah and attribute falsehoods to Him. It emphasizes that on the Day of Resurrection, they will realize the grave error of their ways.

Not even an atom's weight escapes your Lord on earth or in heaven, nor anything smaller or greater than that, but it is recorded in a Clear Book.","Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is All-Knowing and Ever-Watchful over all our actions, words, and even thoughts. Nothing, not even the smallest particle, is hidden from His knowledge. Every single deed, whether good or bad, is being recorded meticulously in the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfudh). This verse instills a sense of accountability and consciousness of Allah's presence at all times, which should motivate us to be mindful of our actions and strive to please Him.",وما تكون في شأن وما تتلو منه من قرآن ولا تعملون من عمل إلا كنا عليكم شهودا إذ تفيضون فيه وما يعزب عن ربك من مثقال ذرة في الأرض ولا في السماء ولا أصغر من ذلك ولا أكبر إلا في كتاب مبين

That is what is the great attainment.,"This verse promises the believers glad tidings and good news in this life and in the Hereafter. The ""words of Allah"" refer to His promises and decrees, which are unchanging and will certainly be fulfilled.

He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.","This verse is a reassurance to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and a reminder not to be saddened by the words and rejection of the disbelievers. It emphasizes that true honor and glory belong solely to Allah, Who is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. The believers should not seek honor from people, but rather seek the honor that comes from Allah by obeying Him and following His commandments.",ولا يحزنك قولهم إن العزة لله جميعا هو السميع العليم
1429,10,66,"No doubt! Verily, to Allah belongs whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth.

Do you say about Allah what you do not know?","This verse refutes the belief held by some that Allah has a son. It emphasizes Allah's transcendence and self-sufficiency, stating that He is far above the need for offspring. Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. The verse challenges those who make such claims, asking them to provide evidence, as they are attributing something to Allah without knowledge.",قالوا اتخذ الله ولدا سبحانه هو الغني له ما في السماوات وما في الأرض إن عندكم من سلطان بهذا أتقولون على الله ما لا تعلمون

Then let not your plan be obscure to you. Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite.'","The interpretation of this verse is that Allah commanded the Prophet Muhammad to recite the story of Prophet Noah to his people. Noah called his people to worship Allah alone, but they rejected his message. He told them that if his preaching and reminding them of Allah's signs was too much for them to bear, he had put his trust in Allah. He challenged them to devise their plan along with their idols and false gods, and then carry it out against him without any delay or respite.",واتل عليهم نبأ نوح إذ قال لقومه يا قوم إن كان كبر عليكم مقامي وتذكيري بآيات الله فعلى الله توكلت فأجمعوا أمركم وشركاءكم ثم لا يكن أمركم عليكم غمة ثم اقضوا إلي ولا تنظرون

Then see how was the end of those who were warned.","This verse refers to the story of Prophet Noah and his people. Despite Noah's warnings, his people denied his message and refused to believe in God's signs. As a result, God saved Noah and those who believed in him by allowing them to board the ark, while drowning the disbelievers in the flood. The verse highlights that those who heeded the warning were made ""successors"" or inheritors of the earth, while the disbelievers faced a tragic end. It serves as a lesson to reflect on the consequences of denying God's signs and messengers.",فكذبوه فنجيناه ومن معه في الفلك وجعلناهم خلائف وأغرقنا الذين كذبوا بآياتنا فانظر كيف كان عاقبة المنذرين
1437,10,74,"Then We sent after him messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear proofs. But they were not to believe in that which they had denied before. Thus do We seal over the hearts of the transgressors.","This verse emphasizes that after rejecting previous messengers, God continued to send more messengers with clear signs and proofs, but those who had rejected the truth before were unlikely to believe due to their hardened hearts. It highlights God's mercy in sending guidance repeatedly, but also the consequence of continuously rejecting it, which leads to spiritual blindness and sealing of the heart against faith.",ثم بعثنا من بعده رسلا إلى قومهم فجاءوهم بالبينات فما كانوا ليؤمنوا بما كذبوا به من قبل كذلك نطبع على قلوب المعتدين

This shows their stubbornness, arrogance, and unwillingness to accept the truth, despite its clarity and evidence.",فلما جاءهم الحق من عندنا قالوا إن هذا لسحر مبين
1440,10,77,"Musa said: ""Will you say for the truth when it has come to you, 'This is magic?' But magicians will not succeed.""","This verse refers to the confrontation between Prophet Musa (Moses) and the sorcerers of Pharaoh's court. When Musa performed the miracle of turning his staff into a serpent, the sorcerers accused him of practicing magic. However, Musa refuted their claim by stating that what he had brought was the truth from Allah, and that true magic or sorcery can never triumph over the truth and signs of Allah. The verse emphasizes that the truth will always prevail over falsehood and deception.",قال موسى أتقولون للحق لما جاءكم أسحر هذا ولا يفلح الساحرون

1444,10,81,"But when they threw, Moses said: 'What you have brought is magic. Surely, Allah will render it vain. Indeed, Allah does not promote the work of the corrupt.'","This verse refers to the contest between Moses and the magicians of Pharaoh's court. When the magicians cast their spells, which appeared to be ropes and snakes, Moses was not deceived. He affirmed that what they had done was mere magic tricks, and that Allah would expose their deception. Moses had faith that Allah would not allow the work of those who spread corruption and disbelief to succeed.",فلما ألقوا قال موسى ما جئتم به السحر إن الله سيبطله إن الله لا يصلح عمل المفسدين

And indeed, Pharaoh was haughty within the land, and indeed, he was among the transgressors.","The interpretation of this verse is that only a small group of people from Moses' nation believed in him and his message, while the majority did not believe due to their fear of Pharaoh and his powerful establishment. They were afraid that if they believed in Moses, Pharaoh would persecute and oppress them. The verse also highlights Pharaoh's arrogance and transgression, as he considered himself superior and did not submit to the truth brought by Moses.",فما آمن لموسى إلا ذرية من قومه على خوف من فرعون وملئهم أن يفتنهم وإن فرعون لعال في الأرض وإنه لمن المسرفين
1447,10,84,"And Moses said: 'O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if you are Muslims.'","""This verse encourages the believers to have complete trust and reliance in Allah after having faith in Him. It emphasizes that true faith necessitates putting one's trust in Allah alone, as He is the only One worthy of being depended upon. This trust should be unwavering, especially in times of difficulty or hardship. The verse links tawakkul (trust in Allah) with being a true Muslim, indicating that it is an essential component of the Islamic faith.""",وقال موسى يا قوم إن كنتم آمنتم بالله فعليه توكلوا إن كنتم مسلمين
1448,10,85,They said: 'In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the wrongdoing people.',"This verse expresses the strong faith and reliance on Allah by the believers.

When Pharaoh was about to drown, he declared his belief in the God of the Israelites and claimed to be a Muslim (one who submits to God). However, his declaration of faith at that moment was too late and insincere, as he had persisted in disbelief and oppression until the very end.",وجاوزنا ببني إسرائيل البحر فأتبعهم فرعون وجنوده بغيا وعدوا حتى إذا أدركه الغرق قال آمنت أنه لا إله إلا الذي آمنت به بنو إسرائيل وأنا من المسلمين

The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.","If you have any lingering doubts about the divine origin of the Qur'an revealed to you, then consult those who have studied the previous scriptures, for they will recognize the truth and consistency of this revelation with the earlier ones. The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord, so do not allow yourself to be swayed by the skeptics and doubters.",فإن كنت في شك مما أنزلنا إليك فاسأل الذين يقرءون الكتاب من قبلك لقد جاءك الحق من ربك فلا تكونن من الممترين
1458,10,95,"And do not be of those who denied the signs of Allah, lest you become of the losers.","This verse warns against denying or rejecting the signs and revelations of Allah, as doing so will lead one to be among the losers in this life and the Hereafter. It emphasizes the importance of believing in and following the guidance provided by Allah through His signs and revelations, and the dire consequences of disbelief and rejection.",ولا تكونن من الذين كذبوا بآيات الله فتكون من الخاسرين
1459,10,96,"Indeed, those upon whom the word of your Lord has become due will not believe.","This verse indicates that those who have been destined by Allah's decree to be disbelievers and reject faith will not embrace belief, no matter how clear the signs and proofs are presented to them. Their hearts are sealed, and their minds are closed to the truth. Allah knows best who they are, and He has left them to persist in their disbelief as a consequence of their own choices and actions.",إن الذين حقت عليهم كلمت ربك لا يؤمنون
1460,10,97,And even if every sign should come to them - until they see the painful punishment...,"This verse emphasizes that no matter how many signs and proofs are presented to the disbelievers, they will not believe until they face the painful punishment of the Hereafter. Their stubbornness and rejection of faith is so severe that even witnessing miracles will not convince them until it is too late and they experience the torment they had been warned about.",ولو جاءتهم كل آية حتى يروا العذاب الأليم
1461,10,98,"But why was there not a town that believed - so its faith would benefit it - except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time.","This verse highlights the importance of faith and belief in God. It states that no town benefited from its faith except the people of Jonah, who were saved from a disgraceful punishment in this worldly life when they believed. This shows that faith and belief in God bring blessings and remove hardships, while disbelief leads to punishment and disgrace.",فلولا كانت قرية آمنت فنفعها إيمانها إلا قوم يونس لما آمنوا كشفنا عنهم عذاب الخزي في الحياة الدنيا ومتعناهم إلى حين
1462,10,99,"And if your Lord had willed, surely all those who are in the earth would have believed, all of them; will you then force people until they become believers?","Allah is reminding us that faith is a matter of free will and choice. He has given human beings the ability to reason and the freedom to accept or reject faith. Forcing someone to believe goes against the principle of free will that Allah has bestowed upon us. True faith comes from a sincere conviction in one's heart, not through coercion or compulsion.",ولو شاء ربك لآمن من في الأرض كلهم جميعا أفأنت تكره الناس حتى يكونوا مؤمنين
1463,10,100,"And it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of Allah, and He will place defilement upon those who will not use reason.","This verse emphasizes that true faith and belief in Allah can only be attained by His permission and guidance. It also warns that those who refuse to use their intellect and reason will have spiritual impurity (""defilement"") placed upon them by Allah as a consequence of their willful ignorance and rejection of the truth.",وما كان لنفس أن تؤمن إلا بإذن الله ويجعل الرجس على الذين لا يعقلون
1464,10,101,"Say, ""Observe what is in the heavens and the earth."" But of what avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe?","This verse emphasizes that no amount of signs or warnings will benefit those who have chosen not to believe. The disbelievers are heedless to the clear evidence of Allah's existence and power manifest in the heavens and the earth. Their stubborn rejection of faith renders all signs and admonitions ineffective for them. The verse implies that belief requires an open heart and mind, which the disbelievers lack due to their arrogance and obstinacy.",قل انظروا ماذا في السماوات والأرض وما تغني الآيات والنذر عن قوم لا يؤمنون
1465,10,102,"Do they await except the likes of the days which befell those who were before them? Say: 'Then wait, for I am with you among the waiters.'","This verse is a warning to the disbelievers who stubbornly rejected the message of Islam. It reminds them that they should not expect a fate different from those who denied the truth before them and were consequently punished. The Prophet is instructed to tell them to wait for the punishment if they insist on their ways, for he too is waiting and watching their actions with patience, as decreed by Allah.",فهل ينتظرون إلا مثل أيام الذين خلوا من قبلهم قل فانتظروا إني معكم من المنتظرين
1466,10,103,"Then We will surely save Our messengers and those who have believed. Thus, it is incumbent upon Us to save the believers.",This verse indicates that Allah will surely save and protect His messengers and those who believe in them from persecution and harm inflicted by the disbelievers. It is a divine obligation upon Allah to deliver the believers from oppression and grant them salvation and victory over their enemies. This promise of divine assistance and deliverance serves as a source of reassurance and hope for the believers in the face of adversity.,ثم ننجي رسلنا والذين آمنوا كذلك حقا علينا ننج المؤمنين
1467,10,104,"Say, ""O people, if you are in doubt about my religion - then I do not worship those you worship besides Allah but I worship Allah, who causes your death. And I have been commanded to be of the believers.""","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad to address the disbelievers and declare that if they have any doubts about his religion, he does not worship the idols or false deities they worship besides Allah. Rather, he worships Allah alone, who has control over their lives and deaths. The Prophet is commanded to be among the true believers in Allah's Oneness.",قل يا أيها الناس إن كنتم في شك من ديني فلا أعبد الذين تعبدون من دون الله ولكن أعبد الله الذي يتوفاكم وأمرت أن أكون من المؤمنين
1468,10,105,"And set your face towards the religion, upright, and do not be among those who associate others with Allah.","""This verse commands the Prophet Muhammad, and by extension all believers, to devote themselves sincerely to the religion of Islam and to worship Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a pure monotheistic belief and rejecting polytheism or the worship of any other deities besides Allah.""",وأن أقم وجهك للدين حنيفا ولا تكونن من المشركين
1469,10,106,"And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then you would be of the wrongdoers.","This verse prohibits invoking or worshipping anything besides Allah, as doing so brings no benefit and is a form of wrongdoing. It emphasizes the futility of polytheism and idolatry, as only Allah has the power to benefit or harm. By associating partners with Allah, one becomes among the wrongdoers who have strayed from the straight path.",ولا تدع من دون الله ما لا ينفعك ولا يضرك فإن فعلت فإنك إذا من الظالمين
1470,10,107,"And if Allah should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him. And if He intends for you good, then there is no averter of His bounty. He causes it to reach whomever He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.","""This verse highlights Allah's absolute power and control over all affairs. It emphasizes that if Allah decrees any adversity or harm upon a person, no one except Allah can remove or alleviate it. Conversely, if Allah intends good and bounty for someone, no one can prevent or repel that either. Allah bestows His favors upon whomever He wills from among His servants. The verse also reminds us of Allah's attributes of being the Forgiving and the Merciful, encouraging us to turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness and mercy.""",وإن يمسسك الله بضر فلا كاشف له إلا هو وإن يردك بخير فلا راد لفضله يصيب به من يشاء من عباده وهو الغفور الرحيم
1471,10,108,"Say, ""O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever goes astray only goes astray [in violation] against it. And I am not over you a guardian.""","""This verse emphasizes the individual responsibility of each person in accepting or rejecting the truth. The Prophet's role is only to convey the message, not to force people to believe. Guidance is a personal choice, and those who accept it benefit themselves, while those who reject it harm only themselves. The Prophet is not accountable for their choices.""",قل يا أيها الناس قد جاءكم الحق من ربكم فمن اهتدى فإنما يهتدي لنفسه ومن ضل فإنما يضل عليها وما أنا عليكم بوكيل
1472,10,109,"And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah judges, for He is the best of judges.","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to adhere to the divine revelations he receives from Allah and to exercise patience in the face of adversity or opposition until Allah passes His judgment. It emphasizes that Allah's judgment is the most just and fair, as He is ""the best of judges.""",واتبع ما يوحى إليك واصبر حتى يحكم الله وهو خير الحاكمين
1473,11,1,"Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book whose verses are perfected, then expounded by One who is All-Wise, All-Aware.","This verse introduces the Qur'an as a divinely revealed book whose verses have been perfected and then expounded in detail by Allah, who is All-Wise and All-Aware. It emphasizes the Qur'an's divine origin, perfection, and clarity, as well as Allah's wisdom and knowledge in revealing it.",الر كتاب أحكمت آياته ثم فصلت من لدن حكيم خبير
1474,11,2,"Worship none but Allah. Verily, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.","The interpretation of this verse is that ""The Prophet Muhammad is commanded to call people to worship only Allah, the One True God, and to convey to them the warning of punishment for those who disobey, as well as the glad tidings of reward for those who believe and do righteous deeds. The Prophet's role is to deliver this message clearly, while the choice to accept or reject it lies with the people.""",ألا تعبدوا إلا الله إنني لكم منه نذير وبشير
1475,11,3,"And seek forgiveness from your Lord and repent to Him, He will grant you a good provision until an appointed term, and bestow His abounding grace on every one endowed with grace. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the punishment of a great Day.","This verse encourages seeking forgiveness from Allah and repenting sincerely to Him. It promises a good provision and blessings for those who do so until their appointed time. However, it warns that turning away from Allah will bring the fear of a severe punishment on a great Day of Judgment. It emphasizes the importance of seeking Allah's forgiveness, repenting, and being grateful for His grace and favors.",وأن استغفروا ربكم ثم توبوا إليه يمتعكم متاعا حسنا إلى أجل مسمى ويؤت كل ذي فضل فضله وإن تولوا فإني أخاف عليكم عذاب يوم كبير
1476,11,4,"To Allah is your return, and He is over all things competent.","This verse reminds us that our ultimate return and accountability is to Allah, who has complete power and control over all things. It emphasizes the importance of being mindful of our actions and striving to please Allah, as we will ultimately answer to Him for our deeds. The verse also highlights Allah's omnipotence and ability to carry out whatever He wills, instilling a sense of reverence and reliance on His might and wisdom.",إلى الله مرجعكم وهو على كل شيء قدير
1477,11,5,"No! They fold up their breasts to hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Indeed, He is All-Aware of what is in the breasts.","This verse indicates that no matter how hard people try to hide their true intentions and thoughts from Allah, He is fully aware of what is in their hearts and minds. They may attempt to conceal their disbelief or evil plans, but Allah knows their secrets as well as what they reveal openly. His knowledge encompasses everything that is in the depths of people's souls.",ألا إنهم يثنون صدورهم ليستخفوا منه ألا حين يستغشون ثيابهم يعلم ما يسرون وما يعلنون إنه عليم بذات الصدور
1478,11,6,"And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a clear Book.","This verse affirms Allah's complete knowledge and control over all His creatures. It means that Allah alone provides sustenance for every living being on earth, and He knows exactly where each creature lives and where it stores its provisions. All of this information is recorded in a clear Book, which refers to the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfudh) containing Allah's complete knowledge of everything.",وما من دابة في الأرض إلا على الله رزقها ويعلم مستقرها ومستودعها كل في كتاب مبين
1479,11,7,"And He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was upon the water, that He might test you as to which of you is best in deeds. And if you were to say, ""You will indeed be resurrected after death,"" those who disbelieve would say, ""This is nothing but obvious magic.""","This verse highlights Allah's power as the Creator of the heavens and the earth in six days, with His Throne being upon the water. It states that the purpose of creation is to test humankind and see who excels in good deeds. The verse also addresses the disbelievers' rejection of the concept of resurrection after death, dismissing it as mere ""obvious magic,"" which reflects their lack of faith.",وهو الذي خلق السماوات والأرض في ستة أيام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم أيكم أحسن عملا ولئن قلت إنكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا إن هذا إلا سحر مبين

Unquestionably, the Day it comes to them it will not be averted from them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.","Allah is warning the disbelievers that if He delays punishing them for their sins in this life, they should not think that the punishment will never come. It will surely come on the Day of Resurrection, and on that Day, they will not be able to escape or avoid it. They will be surrounded by the very punishment that they used to mock and make fun of in this world.",ولئن أخرنا عنهم العذاب إلى أمة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه ألا يوم يأتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزئون
1481,11,9,"And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and impatience of human beings. When Allah bestows His mercy and blessings upon a person, they enjoy and feel content with it. However, if that mercy is withdrawn or taken away from them, they become despairing, hopeless, and ungrateful for the previous favors they had enjoyed. This shows the weakness of human nature and the importance of being grateful to Allah in all circumstances.",ولئن أذقنا الإنسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه إنه ليئوس كفور
1482,11,10,"And if We give him a taste of mercy after adversity has touched him, he will surely say, ""The evils have departed from me."" Indeed, he is exultant and boastful.","This verse highlights the ungrateful and arrogant nature of some people. When they experience hardship or difficulty, they become distressed and complain. However, when Allah blesses them with favors and comforts after that adversity, they become arrogant and attribute their success to themselves rather than being grateful to Allah. They forget the previous difficulties they faced and boast about their achievements, considering themselves self-sufficient and not in need of Allah's guidance and mercy. This attitude reflects ingratitude towards Allah's blessings and a lack of humility.",ولئن أذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السيئات عني إنه لفرح فخور
1483,11,11,But those who are patient and do righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and great reward.,"This verse emphasizes the importance of patience and righteous actions. It promises forgiveness and a great reward from Allah for those who persevere through difficulties and strive to do good deeds. The interpretation highlights that true faith is not just a matter of belief, but also requires steadfastness and actively working towards righteousness in one's life.",إلا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات أولئك لهم مغفرة وأجر كبير
1484,11,12,"Then perhaps you would leave out a part of what is revealed to you, and you would feel distressed in your breast from their saying, 'Why has a treasure not been sent down to him, or an angel not come with him?' You are only a warner, and Allah is a Disposer of all things.","This verse is addressing the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. It suggests that he may have felt inclined to omit parts of the revelation due to the demands and mockery of the disbelievers, who asked why a treasure or an angel did not accompany him as proof of his prophethood. However, the verse reminds him that his role is solely to deliver the warning, while Allah is the ultimate authority over all matters.",فلعلك تارك بعض ما يوحى إليك وضائق به صدرك أن يقولوا لولا أنزل عليه كنز أو جاء معه ملك إنما أنت نذير والله على كل شيء وكيل
1485,11,13,"Or do they say, ""He has forged it""? Say, ""Then bring ten forged surahs like it and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.""","This verse challenges those who accuse the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of forging the Qur'an. It invites them to produce even ten surahs (chapters) like those of the Qur'an if they claim it is forged. The inability to meet this challenge is evidence that the Qur'an is indeed the Word of Allah, and not a human fabrication. The verse emphasizes the inimitable nature of the Qur'an's linguistic and literary excellence, which proves its divine origin.",أم يقولون افتراه قل فأتوا بعشر سور مثله مفتريات وادعوا من استطعتم من دون الله إن كنتم صادقين
1486,11,14,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that it was not sent down except by the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no deity except Him. So, will you be Muslims?","This verse emphasizes that the Qur'an was revealed by the knowledge and will of Allah alone, and that there is no other true deity worthy of worship besides Him. It calls upon people to submit to Allah by embracing Islam, regardless of whether others respond positively or not.",فإلم يستجيبوا لكم فاعلموا أنما أنزل بعلم الله وأن لا إله إلا هو فهل أنتم مسلمون
1487,11,15,"Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments, We shall pay them in full for their deeds therein, and they will not be deprived.","This verse indicates that those who desire the worldly life and its material pleasures will be given what they have earned in this world, but they will not receive any reward in the Hereafter. The implication is that one should not be solely focused on the temporary delights of this world, but should also strive for the everlasting rewards of the Hereafter.",من كان يريد الحياة الدنيا وزينتها نوف إليهم أعمالهم فيها وهم فيها لا يبخسون
1488,11,16,"Those are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire, and lost is what they did therein, and vain is what they used to do.","This verse refers to the disbelievers and those who reject faith. It states that in the Hereafter, they will have nothing but the punishment of Hellfire. All their deeds and actions in this worldly life will be rendered futile and worthless, as they were not based on faith and done for the sake of Allah. Their efforts and works will be in vain, as they lacked the essential element of belief in the One True God.",أولئك الذين ليس لهم في الآخرة إلا النار وحبط ما صنعوا فيها وباطل ما كانوا يعملون
1489,11,17,"Is one who is upon clear evidence from his Lord, and a witness from Him follows it, and before it was the Book of Moses - a guide and a mercy? Those believe in it. But whoever disbelieves in it from the factions - the Fire is the promised place for them. So be not in doubt of it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe.","This verse contrasts the believers who follow the clear evidence and guidance from God with the disbelievers who reject it. The believers have the Qur'an, which is a continuation of previous revelations like the Torah given to Moses, as a guide and mercy. Those who reject the Qur'an from among the various factions will have the Fire as their promised destination. The verse emphasizes that the Qur'an is the truth from God, but most people stubbornly refuse to believe in it.",أفمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه ومن قبله كتاب موسى إماما ورحمة أولئك يؤمنون به ومن يكفر به من الأحزاب فالنار موعده فلا تك في مرية منه إنه الحق من ربك ولكن أكثر الناس لا يؤمنون
1490,11,18,"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah? Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, 'These are the ones who lied against their Lord.' Unquestionably, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.","This verse warns against the grave sin of attributing falsehood to Allah. Those who fabricate lies and ascribe them to Allah are considered the most unjust people. On the Day of Judgment, they will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will testify against them, confirming that they lied against Allah. The verse emphasizes that Allah's curse will undoubtedly be upon those wrongdoers who dared to attribute lies to Him.",ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا أولئك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الأشهاد هؤلاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم ألا لعنة الله على الظالمين
1491,11,19,"Those who hinder (others) from the Path of Allah and seek crookedness therein, and they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.","This verse refers to those who obstruct others from following Allah's guidance and the straight path. They actively try to mislead people and promote deviation and crookedness in religion. Moreover, they reject the belief in the Hereafter and the accountability on the Day of Judgment. Their disbelief in the life after death is the root cause of their misguided actions.",الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالآخرة هم كافرون
1492,11,20,"Those were not the ones who were outdone on the earth, nor did they have any protectors besides Allah, for whom the punishment would be multiplied. They could not hear, nor could they see.","This verse is referring to those who rejected faith and denied the signs of Allah. It states that they were not able to escape Allah's punishment on earth, nor did they have any helpers or protectors besides Allah who could shield them from the intensified punishment. They were spiritually deaf and blind, unable to comprehend the truth or see the signs of Allah's existence and power.",أولئك لم يكونوا معجزين في الأرض وما كان لهم من دون الله من أولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون
1493,11,21,"Those are the ones who have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent.",This verse refers to those who disbelieved and rejected the truth. They have ruined themselves by turning away from faith and following falsehoods. All the lies and fabrications they attributed to Allah have been rendered useless and have no value or benefit for them. They have lost the opportunity to attain salvation and will face the consequences of their actions.,أولئك الذين خسروا أنفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون
1494,11,22,"No doubt, in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers.","This verse emphasizes that those who reject faith and truth in this world will be the ultimate losers in the Hereafter. Their disbelief and arrogance will lead them to a state of immense loss and deprivation in the next life, where they will face the consequences of their actions and miss out on the eternal rewards and bliss promised to the believers.",لا جرم أنهم في الآخرة هم الأخسرون
1495,11,23,"Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their Lord - it is they who are the companions of Paradise; they will abide eternally therein.","This verse highlights the criteria for attaining eternal Paradise: having faith (iman), performing good deeds, and humbling oneself before God. It promises that those who meet these conditions will be the dwellers of Paradise, where they will reside forever. The emphasis is on the combination of faith, righteous actions, and a humble attitude towards the Divine, leading to the ultimate reward of eternal bliss in Paradise.",إن الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات وأخبتوا إلى ربهم أولئك أصحاب الجنة هم فيها خالدون
1496,11,24,"The example of the two groups is like the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing. Are they equal in example? Will you not then take admonition?","This verse draws a comparison between two groups: those who are spiritually blind and deaf (the disbelievers), and those who can see and hear the truth (the believers). It emphasizes that these two groups are not equal, just as a blind and deaf person is not equal to one who can see and hear. The verse is calling people to reflect and take a lesson from this clear example, urging them to open their spiritual eyes and ears to the truth of faith.",مثل الفريقين كالأعمى والأصم والبصير والسميع هل يستويان مثلا أفلا تذكرون
1497,11,25,"And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, [saying], 'Indeed, I am to you a clear warner'",Allah sent Noah as a messenger to his people to warn them clearly against associating partners with Allah and to call them to worship Allah alone. Noah conveyed the message of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah) and warned his people of the consequences of rejecting faith and continuing in their disbelief and polytheistic practices.,ولقد أرسلنا نوحا إلى قومه إني لكم نذير مبين
1498,11,26,"That you worship none but Allah. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.","This verse emphasizes the core message of Islamic monotheism, commanding the worship of Allah alone and warning against the consequences of associating partners with Him. The interpretation is: ""The main purpose of this verse is to instruct people to devote their worship solely to Allah, the One True God, and to abstain from idolatry or polytheism. The Prophet is conveying Allah's message, expressing his sincere concern for the people and cautioning them against the severe punishment that awaits those who reject the worship of the One God on the painful Day of Judgment.""",أن لا تعبدوا إلا الله إني أخاف عليكم عذاب يوم أليم
1499,11,27,"But the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said, 'We see you only as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest among us, immature in judgement. And we do not see in you all any merit over us; rather, we think you are liars.'","This verse refers to the arrogant response of the disbelieving leaders of the Prophet's people when he called them to Islam. They arrogantly dismissed him as just an ordinary man like themselves, and mocked his followers as being from the lowest classes and lacking wisdom. They also denied that he had any merit or superiority over them, accusing him of lying about his prophethood.",فقال الملأ الذين كفروا من قومه ما نراك إلا بشرا مثلنا وما نراك اتبعك إلا الذين هم أراذلنا بادي الرأي وما نرى لكم علينا من فضل بل نظنكم كاذبين

If I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself, but it has been obscured from you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?'","The Prophet is asking his people, if he has been given clear evidence and guidance from God, and God has bestowed His mercy upon him, but they are unable to perceive it due to their arrogance and stubbornness, should he still try to force them to accept the truth against their will? The verse implies that faith cannot be imposed, and people must be willing to accept the truth with an open heart and mind.",قال يا قوم أرأيتم إن كنت على بينة من ربي وآتاني رحمة من عنده فعميت عليكم أنلزمكموها وأنتم لها كارهون
1501,11,29,"And O my people, I ask of you no wealth for it. My reward is only from Allah. And I am not going to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.","""I do not demand any payment or reward from you for conveying Allah's message. My reward comes solely from Allah. I will not turn away or reject those who have believed in Allah, for they will meet their Lord on the Day of Judgment.

1502,11,30,"And O my people, who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Then will you not remember?","This verse implies that the Prophet is reminding his people that if he were to drive away or reject the believers, he would essentially be opposing Allah's command. He questions them rhetorically, asking who could then help or protect him from Allah's punishment for such disobedience. The verse calls upon the people to reflect and remember that opposing Allah and His Prophet has grave consequences.",ويا قوم من ينصرني من الله إن طردتهم أفلا تذكرون
1503,11,31,"Nor do I say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. Nor do I say to those whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will not bestow any good upon them. Allah knows best what is in their souls. Indeed, I would then be one of the wrongdoers.","This verse emphasizes the Prophet's humility and his rejection of any divine attributes or knowledge of the unseen. He clarifies that he does not claim to possess Allah's treasures, know the unseen, or be an angel. He also affirms that he does not look down upon or belittle anyone, as only Allah knows what is in people's souls. The Prophet declares that making such claims or judgments would make him one of the wrongdoers.",ولا أقول لكم عندي خزائن الله ولا أعلم الغيب ولا أقول إني ملك ولا أقول للذين تزدري أعينكم لن يؤتيهم الله خيرا الله أعلم بما في أنفسهم إني إذا لمن الظالمين

Their tone is one of arrogance and defiance, refusing to believe Noah's message despite his persistent efforts to guide them. The interpretation highlights the disbelievers' stubborn rejection of the truth and their demand for immediate punishment as proof, rather than heeding the warning and repenting.",قالوا يا نوح قد جادلتنا فأكثرت جدالنا فأتنا بما تعدنا إن كنت من الصادقين
1505,11,33,"He said, 'Allah alone can bring it to you, if He wills, and you cannot frustrate it.'","This verse implies that the Prophet Muhammad was not the source of revelation, but rather it was Allah who revealed the Qur'an to him through the Angel Gabriel. The Prophet had no control over when or how the revelation would come, as it was entirely dependent on Allah's will. The verse emphasizes the divine origin of the Qur'an and the Prophet's role as a messenger, not an author or inventor of the scripture.",قال إنما يأتيكم به الله إن شاء وما أنتم بمعجزين
1506,11,34,"But my advice will not benefit you, even if I wished to advise you, if Allah intends to leave you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will return.","This verse suggests that guidance comes from Allah alone. Even if the Prophet wished to advise or guide someone, it would not benefit them if Allah wills for them to remain misguided. Ultimately, Allah is the Lord and to Him all will return to be judged for their beliefs and actions.",ولا ينفعكم نصحي إن أردت أن أنصح لكم إن كان الله يريد أن يغويكم هو ربكم وإليه ترجعون
1507,11,35,"Or do they say, ""He has invented it?"" Say, ""If I have invented it, then upon me is my guilt, and I am free from what you commit of sins.""","This verse addresses those who accused the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of fabricating the Qur'an. It instructs him to respond by saying that if he had indeed invented it, then the sin of fabrication would be upon him alone, and he would be innocent of the sins and disbelief that they are committing.",أم يقولون افتراه قل إن افتريته فعلي إجرامي وأنا بريء مما تجرمون
1508,11,36,"And it was revealed to Noah that none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they used to do.","This verse indicates that Allah revealed to Prophet Noah that only those among his people who had already believed would continue to believe in his message, and that he should not grieve over the disbelief and actions of the others.

1509,11,37,"And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned.","Allah commanded Prophet Nuh (Noah) to build the Ark under His divine guidance and protection.

1510,11,38,"And he constructed the ark, and whenever an assembly of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ""If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule.""","This verse describes the situation of the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) while he was building the ark. Despite facing mockery and ridicule from his people, he remained steadfast in his mission and warned them that just as they were mocking him, they too would be mocked for their disbelief and rejection of the truth.",ويصنع الفلك وكلما مر عليه ملأ من قومه سخروا منه قال إن تسخروا منا فإنا نسخر منكم كما تسخرون
1511,11,39,"So you will come to know who it is to whom comes a punishment disgracing him, and on whom descends an enduring punishment.",This verse warns the disbelievers that they will soon realize who will be humiliated by Allah's punishment and who will suffer a lasting torment. It implies that the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and everlasting than any worldly punishment.,فسوف تعلمون من يأتيه عذاب يخزيه ويحل عليه عذاب مقيم
1512,11,40,"Until, when Our Command came and the oven overflowed, We said: 'Load therein a pair of every kind, and your family - except those against whom the Word has already gone forth - and those who believe.'

When the time came for the punishment to strike the disbelieving people, and the oven (referring to the oven that would produce the waters of the flood) ""overflowed,"" Allah commanded Nuh to take aboard the Ark pairs of all creatures, along with the believers from his family and followers. However, only a small number of people believed in Nuh and joined him on the Ark, while the majority rejected his message.",حتى إذا جاء أمرنا وفار التنور قلنا احمل فيها من كل زوجين اثنين وأهلك إلا من سبق عليه القول ومن آمن وما آمن معه إلا قليل

Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.'","This verse describes the intense scene of the flood and Noah's Ark sailing through massive waves as high as mountains. Despite the perilous situation, Noah calls out to his son, who was separated from them, urging him to embark on the Ark and not remain with the disbelievers who denied the warning and mocked Noah's message.",وهي تجري بهم في موج كالجبال ونادى نوح ابنه وكان في معزل يا بني اركب معنا ولا تكن مع الكافرين

And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.","This verse describes the conversation between Prophet Nuh (Noah) and his son during the great flood. When the son refused to believe in Allah and board the ark, he thought he could find safety on a mountain. However, Nuh informed him that on that day, no one could be saved from Allah's decree except those whom Allah had mercy upon. The waves separated them, and the son was among those who drowned, as he had rejected faith and refused to embark on the ark of salvation.",قال سآوي إلى جبل يعصمني من الماء قال لا عاصم اليوم من أمر الله إلا من رحم وحال بينهما الموج فكان من المغرقين

Noah acknowledged Allah's supreme wisdom and justice in judging matters.",ونادى نوح ربه فقال رب إن ابني من أهلي وإن وعدك الحق وأنت أحكم الحاكمين
1518,11,46,He said: 'O Noah! He is not of your family; for his conduct is unrighteous. So ask Me not concerning that whereof thou hast no knowledge. I admonish thee lest thou be among the ignorant.',"This verse indicates that even though someone may be a close relative, if they engage in unrighteous conduct, they cannot be considered part of the believing family. It advises against asking about matters beyond one's knowledge and warns against being among the ignorant who lack proper understanding.",قال يا نوح إنه ليس من أهلك إنه عمل غير صالح فلا تسألن ما ليس لك به علم إني أعظك أن تكون من الجاهلين
1519,11,47,"He said, 'My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.'","This verse teaches us to seek refuge in Allah from asking Him for things that we have no knowledge of, as that would be foolish and inappropriate.

Allah sent Salih as a prophet to guide his people to worship Allah alone and abandon idolatry.

The Qur'an is not a fabricated book, but rather it confirms the divine scriptures that came before it and provides a detailed explanation of all religious and worldly matters. It serves as a guide and a mercy for those who have faith.",لقد كان في قصصهم عبرة لأولي الألباب ما كان حديثا يفترى ولكن تصديق الذي بين يديه وتفصيل كل شيء وهدى ورحمة لقوم يؤمنون
1707,13,1,"These are Verses of the Book, and that which has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the Truth, but most people do not believe.","This verse affirms the truth and divine origin of the Qur'an, which has been revealed by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. However, it also highlights the unfortunate reality that most people reject or disbelieve in this divine revelation, despite its clear and undeniable truth.",المر تلك آيات الكتاب والذي أنزل إليك من ربك الحق ولكن أكثر الناس لا يؤمنون
1708,13,2,"Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then He settled Himself on the Throne. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. He manages all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that you may be certain of meeting your Lord.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute power and sovereignty over the entire universe. The raising of the heavens without visible pillars is a sign of His might. His settling on the Throne symbolizes His authority and control. The subjection of the sun and moon to their precise orbits for a fixed term demonstrates His meticulous planning. He governs all affairs with wisdom, revealing signs for those who reflect, so that they may be convinced of the inevitability of meeting Him on the Day of Judgment.",الله الذي رفع السماوات بغير عمد ترونها ثم استوى على العرش وسخر الشمس والقمر كل يجري لأجل مسمى يدبر الأمر يفصل الآيات لعلكم بلقاء ربكم توقنون
1709,13,3,And it is He who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates. He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.,"This verse highlights Allah's power as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It describes how He spread out the earth, established firm mountains and rivers, and created pairs of fruits. The alternation of night and day is also mentioned as a sign of His might. The verse invites people to contemplate these signs and recognize the greatness of the Creator.",وهو الذي مد الأرض وجعل فيها رواسي وأنهارا ومن كل الثمرات جعل فيها زوجين اثنين يغشي الليل النهار إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يتفكرون

Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.","Cette verse souligne la sagesse et la puissance de Dieu dans la création de la diversité dans la nature. Bien que toutes les plantes soient nourries par la même eau, elles diffèrent en qualité et en saveur des fruits qu'elles produisent. Cela montre que Dieu est le Créateur suprême qui contrôle tout selon Sa volonté et Sa sagesse. Cette diversité dans la création est un signe pour ceux qui réfléchissent et reconnaissent la grandeur de Dieu.",وفي الأرض قطع متجاورات وجنات من أعناب وزرع ونخيل صنوان وغير صنوان يسقى بماء واحد ونفضل بعضها على بعض في الأكل إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يعقلون

Those are the ones who have disbelieved in their Lord, and those will have shackles upon their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.","This verse addresses the incredulity of the disbelievers towards the concept of resurrection after death. It states that if the Prophet Muhammad is amazed by their rejection of this belief, their statement questioning how they could be brought back to life after turning to dust is even more astonishing. It then declares that those who deny their Lord and reject the belief in resurrection will be shackled and will be the dwellers of Hellfire, where they will abide forever as a punishment for their disbelief.",وإن تعجب فعجب قولهم أإذا كنا ترابا أإنا لفي خلق جديد أولئك الذين كفروا بربهم وأولئك الأغلال في أعناقهم وأولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون

And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing. And indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty.","This verse is addressing the disbelievers who mockingly demanded that the punishment be hastened upon them before any good befalls them. It reminds them that previous nations were also punished for their disbelief and wrongdoing. However, it also highlights that Allah is Forgiving towards people despite their transgressions, giving them opportunities to repent. At the same time, it warns that Allah is severe in punishing those who persist in disbelief and wrongdoing.",ويستعجلونك بالسيئة قبل الحسنة وقد خلت من قبلهم المثلات وإن ربك لذو مغفرة للناس على ظلمهم وإن ربك لشديد العقاب

You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.","This verse addresses the disbelievers who demand a miracle from the Prophet Muhammad as proof of his prophethood.

He knows the condition of every pregnant female, whether human or animal, and what is happening in their wombs.

No one can conceal anything from the Divine knowledge and authority.

Dieu ne changera pas la condition d'un peuple tant qu'ils ne changeront pas ce qui est en eux-mêmes. S'ils font le mal, Dieu leur enverra des difficultés, et personne d'autre que Lui ne pourra les protéger.

Those who supplicate to others besides Allah, their supplications are futile and will not be answered, just like someone desperately trying to drink water by stretching out their hands but unable to reach it. The supplications of the disbelievers who reject Allah are misguided and in vain.",له دعوة الحق والذين يدعون من دونه لا يستجيبون لهم بشيء إلا كباسط كفيه إلى الماء ليبلغ فاه وما هو ببالغه وما دعاء الكافرين إلا في ضلال

Say, 'Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Prevailing.'","This verse emphasizes the Oneness and Uniqueness of Allah as the Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth. It condemns the practice of associating partners with Allah, as these so-called partners have no power to benefit or harm anyone. The verse draws a comparison between the blind and the seeing, and between darkness and light, to highlight the stark contrast between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance. It questions how the polytheists can ascribe partners to Allah who create like His creation, when Allah alone is the Creator of all things, the One and the Irresistible.",قل من رب السماوات والأرض قل الله قل أفاتخذتم من دونه أولياء لا يملكون لأنفسهم نفعا ولا ضرا قل هل يستوي الأعمى والبصير أم هل تستوي الظلمات والنور أم جعلوا لله شركاء خلقوا كخلقه فتشابه الخلق عليهم قل الله خالق كل شيء وهو الواحد القهار

And from that [ore] which they heat in the fire, desiring to make ornaments or utensils, is a froth like it. Thus does Allah describe truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it will pass away, being cast off, but what benefits people remains on the earth. Thus does Allah present examples.","This verse uses the metaphor of water and foam to illustrate the distinction between truth and falsehood. The water represents truth that is beneficial and lasting, while the foam represents falsehood that is temporary and ultimately worthless. The foam rises high but soon dissipates, just as falsehood may appear attractive initially but will eventually vanish. In contrast, the water that remains on the earth nourishes life, just as the truth benefits people and endures. Through this vivid imagery, Allah emphasizes the importance of discerning and holding fast to the truth, and rejecting that which is false and fleeting.",أنزل من السماء ماء فسالت أودية بقدرها فاحتمل السيل زبدا رابيا ومما يوقدون عليه في النار ابتغاء حلية أو متاع زبد مثله كذلك يضرب الله الحق والباطل فأما الزبد فيذهب جفاء وأما ما ينفع الناس فيمكث في الأرض كذلك يضرب الله الأمثال

But those who did not respond to Him - if they had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselves thereby. Those will have the worst account, and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.","This verse contrasts the reward for those who answered the call of Allah and believed in Him, with the punishment for those who disbelieved. The believers will receive the best reward from Allah. As for the disbelievers, even if they possessed all the wealth in the world and twice as much, they would gladly give it all as a ransom to save themselves from the punishment on the Day of Judgment. However, no ransom will be accepted from them. They will suffer a terrible reckoning and their final abode will be Hell - a dreadful resting place.",للذين استجابوا لربهم الحسنى والذين لم يستجيبوا له لو أن لهم ما في الأرض جميعا ومثله معه لافتدوا به أولئك لهم سوء الحساب ومأواهم جهنم وبئس المهاد

Only those of understanding receive admonition.,"This verse draws a distinction between those who recognize and accept the truth revealed by God, and those who are blind to it. It implies that true understanding and wisdom lies in acknowledging the divine revelations, while those who reject or ignore them are likened to the spiritually blind. The verse emphasizes that only people of sound intellect and contemplation can truly benefit from God's guidance and admonition.",أفمن يعلم أنما أنزل إليك من ربك الحق كمن هو أعمى إنما يتذكر أولو الألباب

They fulfill the obligations set forth in the Qur'an and the teachings of Islam, and they do not violate or break the sacred covenant they have made with their Lord. It emphasizes the importance of being truthful, trustworthy, and steadfast in one's faith and commitments.",الذين يوفون بعهد الله ولا ينقضون الميثاق

It praises those who exercise patience and perseverance while seeking the pleasure of Allah, establish regular prayer, spend in charity both privately and publicly, and respond to harm with kindness and forgiveness. These virtuous actions lead them to the ultimate reward of the everlasting abode in the Hereafter.",والذين صبروا ابتغاء وجه ربهم وأقاموا الصلاة وأنفقوا مما رزقناهم سرا وعلانية ويدرءون بالحسنة السيئة أولئك لهم عقبى الدار

The interpretation highlights the virtue of patience and steadfastness in the face of hardships, as it leads to the ultimate reward of Paradise.",سلام عليكم بما صبرتم فنعم عقبى الدار
1731,13,25,"And those who break the covenant of Allah after its ratification, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and spread corruption on earth - for them is the curse, and they will have the worst home.","This verse refers to those who break their covenants with Allah after affirming them.

Say, 'Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].'","This verse addresses the demand of the disbelievers for a miraculous sign from the Prophet Muhammad. It emphasizes that Allah guides whom He wills to the truth, and leaves astray those who stubbornly reject faith. The guidance or misguidance depends on one's willingness to turn towards Allah and accept the truth.",ويقول الذين كفروا لولا أنزل عليه آية من ربه قل إن الله يضل من يشاء ويهدي إليه من أناب

Indeed, Allah does not fail in His promise.","The interpretation of this verse is that the Qur'an is a mighty miracle from Allah, but its purpose is not to physically move mountains or tear apart the earth. Rather, its true miracle is in guiding humanity to the truth. However, Allah has given people free will to choose whether to believe or not. Those who disbelieve will face consequences for their actions, either in the form of disasters or punishments that will befall them, until the Day of Judgment arrives, for Allah's promise is true and will be fulfilled.",ولو أن قرآنا سيرت به الجبال أو قطعت به الأرض أو كلم به الموتى بل لله الأمر جميعا أفلم ييأس الذين آمنوا أن لو يشاء الله لهدى الناس جميعا ولا يزال الذين كفروا تصيبهم بما صنعوا قارعة أو تحل قريبا من دارهم حتى يأتي وعد الله إن الله لا يخلف الميعاد

Previous messengers were also ridiculed by their people, but Allah gave those disbelievers a respite and prolonged their enjoyment of worldly pleasures for a time. However, eventually, Allah seized them with His punishment, which was severe and inescapable.

That is the reward for those who were conscious of Allah, while the reward of the disbelievers is the Fire.","This verse presents a vivid metaphor contrasting the eternal bliss of Paradise promised to the righteous with the torment of Hellfire for the disbelievers.

The People of the Book, who received previous scriptures, rejoice in the Qur'an's revelation as it confirms their beliefs. However, some factions reject parts of it due to their biases.

1746,13,40,"And if We show you some of what We have promised them, or cause you to die [before its realization], then upon you is only the [duty of] notification, and upon Us is the account.","This verse emphasizes that the Prophet's responsibility is solely to convey the message, not to force people to believe or ensure its fulfillment. The realization of Allah's promises is up to Him, whether the Prophet witnesses it or not. His duty is to deliver the message faithfully, while accountability for people's deeds rests with Allah.",وإن ما نرينك بعض الذي نعدهم أو نتوفينك فإنما عليك البلاغ وعلينا الحساب

The diminishing of the land from its outskirts is a sign of Allah's might and a reminder of the impermanence of this world. It serves as a warning that one day, this world will come to an end, and all will return to Allah for judgment. The verse emphasizes that Allah's command is final and cannot be overruled, and that He is swift in reckoning, implying the inevitability of accountability on the Day of Judgment.",أولم يروا أنا نأتي الأرض ننقصها من أطرافها والله يحكم لا معقب لحكمه وهو سريع الحساب
1748,13,42,"And those who were before them had plotted, but to Allah belongs all plotting. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will know who gets the good end.","This verse warns against plotting and scheming against the truth.

They will admit that their impatience or patience makes no difference, as there is no escape from Allah's judgment.",وبرزوا لله جميعا فقال الضعفاء للذين استكبروا إنا كنا لكم تبعا فهل أنتم مغنون عنا من عذاب الله من شيء قالوا لو هدانا الله لهديناكم سواء علينا أجزعنا أم صبرنا ما لنا من محيص

And Allah did not wrong them, but they had been wronging themselves.","The interpretation is that the disbelievers are waiting for a clear sign like the angels descending upon them or the punishment of Allah befalling them, just like the previous nations demanded signs before being punished. However, Allah did not wrong them by punishing them without warning; rather, they wronged themselves by rejecting the truth and persisting in disbelief after clear evidences were presented to them.",هل ينظرون إلا أن تأتيهم الملائكة أو يأتي أمر ربك كذلك فعل الذين من قبلهم وما ظلمهم الله ولكن كانوا أنفسهم يظلمون
1934,16,34,"So the evil consequences of what they did overtook them, and they were afflicted by that which they used to mock.","This verse refers to the punishment that befell those who mocked and disbelieved in Allah's revelations and messengers. Their evil deeds resulted in divine retribution, and the very thing they ridiculed - such as the warnings of punishment - became a reality that engulfed them. It serves as a stern warning against denying Allah's signs and making a mockery of His revelations.",فأصابهم سيئات ما عملوا وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزئون
1935,16,35,"And those who associate partners with Allah say, 'If Allah had willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything through other than His command.' Thus did those before them argue falsely until they tasted Our punishment. Say, 'Do you have any knowledge that you can produce before us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying.'",هذه الآية تنتقد حجة المشركين الذين يقولون إنهم لم يعبدوا غير الله إلا لأن الله شاء ذلك. فالله تعالى يرد عليهم بأن هذا مجرد افتراض وظن منهم، وأنهم لا يملكون أي دليل على ما يدعون. كما أن هذه الحجة باطلة لأن الأمم السابقة قالت نفس الشيء ولكنهم عاقبوا على شركهم. فالرسالة واضحة وليس هناك أي عذر لعدم اتباعها.,وقال الذين أشركوا لو شاء الله ما عبدنا من دونه من شيء نحن ولا آباؤنا ولا حرمنا من دونه من شيء كذلك فعل الذين من قبلهم فهل على الرسل إلا البلاغ المبين
1936,16,36,"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid the false deities.' And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those destined for error. So travel through the land and observe how was the end of the deniers.","This verse affirms that Allah has sent messengers to every nation, commanding them to worship Him alone and shun false deities and idols. Some people accepted the guidance and believed in the messengers, while others strayed into misguidance and error. The verse then exhorts people to travel through the lands and observe the ruined remnants of past nations who rejected the messengers, as a lesson about the inevitable consequences of denying the truth.",ولقد بعثنا في كل أمة رسولا أن اعبدوا الله واجتنبوا الطاغوت فمنهم من هدى الله ومنهم من حقت عليه الضلالة فسيروا في الأرض فانظروا كيف كان عاقبة المكذبين
1937,16,37,"If you are eager for their guidance, then surely Allah does not guide those who mislead. And they will have no helpers.","This verse emphasizes that guidance comes from Allah alone. Even if the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was eager to guide those who have gone astray, he cannot do so because Allah does not guide those who choose misguidance. They will have no one to help or support them against Allah's judgment.",إن تحرص على هداهم فإن الله لا يهدي من يضل وما لهم من ناصرين
1938,16,38,"And they swear by Allah with their strongest oaths that Allah will not resurrect one who dies. Yes, [it is] a true promise [binding] upon Him, but most of the people do not know.","This verse refutes the denial of resurrection by those who disbelieved. It affirms that Allah will indeed resurrect the dead, as He has promised in the Qur'an. However, most people are ignorant of this truth due to their lack of faith and understanding.",وأقسموا بالله جهد أيمانهم لا يبعث الله من يموت بلى وعدا عليه حقا ولكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون
1939,16,39,"That He may make clear to them that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars.","This verse indicates that one of the purposes of the revelation of the Qur'an is to clarify the matters of faith and laws in which people differed, so that the truth becomes evident. It also aims to expose the falsehood of the disbelievers who rejected the message, proving that they were lying in their claims against the Prophet and the divine revelation.",ليبين لهم الذي يختلفون فيه وليعلم الذين كفروا أنهم كانوا كاذبين
1940,16,40,"Verily, Our Word unto a thing, when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: 'Be' - and it is.","This verse emphasizes the absolute power and will of Allah. When Allah wills something to exist, He merely commands it to ""Be"" and it comes into existence immediately, without any difficulty or delay. This highlights Allah's ability to create anything He desires with ease and without any need for means or assistance. It is a manifestation of His complete authority and sovereignty over all of creation.",إنما قولنا لشيء إذا أردناه أن نقول له كن فيكون
1941,16,41,"And those who emigrated for the cause of Allah after they had been wronged, We will surely settle them in this world in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.","This verse promises a good life and reward in the Hereafter for those who migrated from their homes for the sake of Allah after being persecuted and oppressed. It encourages the believers to be patient and steadfast in the face of hardship, for their sacrifice will be rewarded by Allah in this world and in the Hereafter, which is far greater than any worldly gain if they truly understood its value.",والذين هاجروا في الله من بعد ما ظلموا لنبوئنهم في الدنيا حسنة ولأجر الآخرة أكبر لو كانوا يعلمون
1942,16,42,Those who are patient and put their trust in their Lord.,"This verse highlights the importance of patience (sabr) and trust in God (tawakkul) for believers. It praises those who exercise patience in the face of difficulties and challenges, and who place their complete reliance and trust in their Lord. Patience and trust in God are seen as essential qualities for maintaining faith and persevering through life's trials and tribulations.",الذين صبروا وعلى ربهم يتوكلون
1943,16,43,"And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed [the message], so ask the people of the message if you do not know.","The interpretation is that Allah has always sent human messengers to convey His message, not angels or other beings. If we have doubts or lack knowledge about the teachings of previous messengers, we should refer to those who possess knowledge, the ""people of the message"" or scholars.",وما أرسلنا من قبلك إلا رجالا نوحي إليهم فاسألوا أهل الذكر إن كنتم لا تعلمون
1944,16,44,"With clear proofs and writings. And We have sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Reminder, that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought.","Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad with clear signs, miracles, and revealed scriptures like the Qur'an. The Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet to explain its teachings clearly to people, so that they may ponder over its guidance and follow the right path.",بالبينات والزبر وأنزلنا إليك الذكر لتبين للناس ما نزل إليهم ولعلهم يتفكرون
1945,16,45,"Then, do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive?",This verse warns those who scheme evil plans and commit sins that they should not feel secure from Allah's punishment. Allah has the power to cause the earth to swallow them or send a punishment upon them from an unexpected source that they cannot foresee or comprehend. It serves as a reminder that no one is safe from Allah's justice and that wrongdoers will ultimately face the consequences of their actions.,أفأمن الذين مكروا السيئات أن يخسف الله بهم الأرض أو يأتيهم العذاب من حيث لا يشعرون
1946,16,46,"Or He seizes them while they are wandering around, for then they have no way to escape.","Allah warns the disbelievers that He has complete power over them, and that He can seize them with punishment while they are traveling or wandering about, and they will have no way to escape His punishment or find refuge from it.",أو يأخذهم في تقلبهم فما هم بمعجزين
1947,16,47,"Or He may take them gradually, for your Lord is truly full of kindness and mercy.","This verse suggests that Allah may either punish people swiftly or gradually for their sins and disbelief. However, it emphasizes that regardless of how the punishment comes, Allah is ""Raoof"" (full of kindness) and ""Raheem"" (merciful). This implies that even in punishment, there is wisdom and mercy from the Most Compassionate, who gives ample opportunities for repentance and reform before any retribution.",أو يأخذهم على تخوف فإن ربكم لرءوف رحيم
1948,16,48,"Have they not observed that whatever Allah has created casts shadows, inclining to the right and to the left, in utter submission to Allah, and they are humbled?","This verse invites people to reflect on the wonders of Allah's creation and how everything in the universe, even the shadows cast by objects, submits humbly to Allah's commands. The shadows' inclination to the right and left as the sun moves across the sky is a sign of their humble obedience to Allah's natural laws. The verse emphasizes that all created beings, including inanimate objects like shadows, prostrate to Allah in submission, while arrogant human beings remain heedless of their Lord's signs.",أولم يروا إلى ما خلق الله من شيء يتفيأ ظلاله عن اليمين والشمائل سجدا لله وهم داخرون
1949,16,49,"And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures, and the angels [as well], and they are not arrogant.","This verse emphasizes the universal submission and humility before Allah. All creatures in the heavens and on earth, including the angels who are closest to Allah, prostrate and humble themselves before Him without any arrogance or pride. It highlights the importance of submission, obedience, and recognizing Allah's greatness and authority over all creation.",ولله يسجد ما في السماوات وما في الأرض من دابة والملائكة وهم لا يستكبرون
1950,16,50,"They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.","This verse refers to the pious believers who have a profound reverence and fear of Allah, recognizing His supremacy and authority over them. They obey His commands without hesitation, fulfilling their religious obligations diligently. The phrase ""from above them"" signifies Allah's transcendence and sovereignty, while their obedience stems from their unwavering faith and submission to the Divine Will.",يخافون ربهم من فوقهم ويفعلون ما يؤمرون
1951,16,51,"And Allah says, 'Do not take two deities. He is only one God, so fear Me alone.'","This verse emphasizes the fundamental Islamic belief in the Oneness of God (Tawhid). It commands the believers not to associate any partners or equals with Allah, as He is the only true God worthy of worship and reverence. The verse stresses the importance of having sincere devotion and awe towards the One and Only God, and rejecting any form of polytheism or idolatry.",وقال الله لا تتخذوا إلهين اثنين إنما هو إله واحد فإياي فارهبون
1952,16,52,"And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is [due all] worship eternally. Then is it other than Allah that you fear?","This verse affirms Allah's absolute sovereignty over the entire universe and that worship is due to Him alone. It questions why anyone would fear anything or anyone other than Allah, the Supreme Lord and Sustainer of all creation.",وله ما في السماوات والأرض وله الدين واصبا أفغير الله تتقون
1953,16,53,"And whatever blessing you have, it is from Allah. Then, when harm touches you, to Him you groan.","This verse reminds us that all blessings and favors we enjoy in life come from Allah alone. However, when we face difficulties or harm, we tend to turn to Him in supplication and seek His aid and relief. It highlights the human tendency to forget Allah during times of ease and prosperity, but remember and call upon Him when faced with hardship or adversity.",وما بكم من نعمة فمن الله ثم إذا مسكم الضر فإليه تجأرون
1954,16,54,"Then, when He removes the affliction from you, a group of you associates others with their Lord.","This verse criticizes the tendency of some people to associate partners with Allah when they are in distress, but then forget Him and return to polytheism when the hardship is removed. It highlights the fickleness and ingratitude of those who turn away from pure monotheism during times of ease, despite calling upon Allah alone during difficulties. The verse serves as a reminder to maintain sincere devotion to Allah at all times, and not to succumb to polytheistic tendencies out of convenience or forgetfulness.",ثم إذا كشف الضر عنكم إذا فريق منكم بربهم يشركون
1955,16,55,"So that they may disbelieve in what We have given them. Then enjoy yourselves, for you will soon know.","This verse warns those who reject the blessings and guidance bestowed upon them by Allah. It suggests that they should enjoy their temporary pleasures and indulgences, for soon they will realize the consequences of their disbelief and ingratitude towards Allah's favors.",ليكفروا بما آتيناهم فتمتعوا فسوف تعلمون
1956,16,56,"Yet they assign a portion of what We have provided them with to what they know not. By Allah, you will indeed be questioned about what you used to fabricate.","This verse condemns the practice of pagan Arabs who would set aside a portion of their wealth, crops, or cattle as offerings to their idols and false deities, which have no knowledge or power to benefit them. It warns them that they will be held accountable by Allah for this act of associating partners with Him and fabricating lies against His religion.",ويجعلون لما لا يعلمون نصيبا مما رزقناهم تالله لتسألن عما كنتم تفترون
1957,16,57,And they assign daughters to Allah - exalted is He - while they have what they desire [for themselves]?,"This verse criticizes the pagan belief of attributing daughters to Allah, which they considered undignified. It highlights the absurdity of their belief, as they desired sons for themselves but assigned daughters to God, whom they claimed to revere. The verse condemns this contradiction and affirms Allah's transcendence above such anthropomorphic attributions.",ويجعلون لله البنات سبحانه ولهم ما يشتهون
1958,16,58,"And when one of them is given good tidings of a female [child], his face remains darkened, and he suppresses grief.","This verse criticizes the practice of some Arabs during the pre-Islamic era who viewed the birth of a daughter as a source of shame and grief. The interpretation is that such an attitude towards female children is wrong and against the teachings of Islam, which values both genders equally.",وإذا بشر أحدهم بالأنثى ظل وجهه مسودا وهو كظيم
1959,16,59,"He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the dust? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.",This verse criticizes the pagan Arab practice of burying newborn daughters alive due to the perceived shame and dishonor associated with having female offspring. It condemns this abhorrent act as an evil judgment stemming from ignorance and misguided cultural norms.,يتوارى من القوم من سوء ما بشر به أيمسكه على هون أم يدسه في التراب ألا ساء ما يحكمون
1960,16,60,"For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is an evil description, and for Allah is the highest attribute. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","This verse highlights the stark contrast between the disbelievers' perception of God and the reality of His supreme attributes. The disbelievers, who reject the concept of the Hereafter, have a distorted and ""evil"" understanding of God, attributing imperfections to Him. However, Allah possesses ""the highest attribute,"" meaning He is free from any deficiency or imperfection. He is ""the Exalted in Might,"" symbolizing His absolute power and dominion over all creation, and ""the Wise,"" signifying His perfect wisdom and flawless judgment in all matters.",للذين لا يؤمنون بالآخرة مثل السوء ولله المثل الأعلى وهو العزيز الحكيم
1961,16,61,"And if Allah were to seize the people for their wrongdoing, He would not leave upon the earth any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede it.","Cette interprétation souligne la miséricorde d'Allah envers Ses créatures. Bien qu'ils commettent des péchés et des injustices, Allah ne les punit pas immédiatement. Au lieu de cela, Il leur accorde un délai pour se repentir et s'amender. Cependant, lorsque ce délai arrivera à son terme, le châtiment sera inévitable et aucun répit supplémentaire ne sera accordé, que ce soit une heure de plus ou de moins.",ولو يؤاخذ الله الناس بظلمهم ما ترك عليها من دابة ولكن يؤخرهم إلى أجل مسمى فإذا جاء أجلهم لا يستأخرون ساعة ولا يستقدمون
1962,16,62,"And they assign to Allah that which they dislike [themselves], and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best [from Allah]. Assuredly, theirs will be the Fire, and they will be forsaken.","This verse criticizes the polytheists who assigned to Allah things they disliked for themselves, such as female offspring or attributing partners to Him. It also condemns their false claims that they will attain Paradise, stating that in reality, Hellfire awaits them for their lies and ingratitude to Allah.",ويجعلون لله ما يكرهون وتصف ألسنتهم الكذب أن لهم الحسنى لا جرم أن لهم النار وأنهم مفرطون
1963,16,63,"By Allah, We have sent (messengers) to nations before you, but Satan made their deeds seem fair to them. So he is their guardian today, and for them is a painful punishment.","This verse indicates that Allah has sent messengers to nations before the Prophet Muhammad, but Satan (Shaytan) deceived them and made their evil deeds seem attractive to them. As a result, Satan has become their guardian and protector on the Day of Judgment, leading them to a painful torment for rejecting the truth and following Satan's footsteps.",تالله لقد أرسلنا إلى أمم من قبلك فزين لهم الشيطان أعمالهم فهو وليهم اليوم ولهم عذاب أليم
1964,16,64,"And We have not sent down the Book to you except that you may make clear to them that wherein they differ, and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.","Allah revealed the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad to clarify and explain the matters of faith and law that people differed about, to guide those who believe to the truth, and to be a source of mercy and blessings for them.",وما أنزلنا عليك الكتاب إلا لتبين لهم الذي اختلفوا فيه وهدى ورحمة لقوم يؤمنون
1965,16,65,And Allah has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen.,"This verse highlights Allah's power and mercy in reviving the lifeless earth through the rain He sends down from the sky. It serves as a profound sign and reminder for those who are willing to listen and reflect upon the divine wisdom and design behind this natural phenomenon. The revival of the earth after its apparent 'death' symbolizes the greater reality of resurrection after death, encouraging believers to have faith in Allah's ability to bring life back after it has departed.",والله أنزل من السماء ماء فأحيا به الأرض بعد موتها إن في ذلك لآية لقوم يسمعون
1966,16,66,"And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excretion and blood - pure milk, palatable to the drinkers.","Allah is reminding us of one of His great blessings upon us, which is the provision of pure, wholesome milk from the bellies of grazing animals. Despite milk originating from a mixture of digested food, blood, and waste matter within the animal's body, Allah has made it pure and pleasantly drinkable for human beings. This verse encourages contemplation of Allah's wisdom and appreciation for His favors upon His creation.",وإن لكم في الأنعام لعبرة نسقيكم مما في بطونه من بين فرث ودم لبنا خالصا سائغا للشاربين
1967,16,67,"And from the fruits of the date-palm and grapevines, you derive intoxicants and wholesome provision. Certainly in that is a sign for people who have wisdom.","""This verse highlights the blessings of Allah in providing nourishment and sustenance from the fruits of date-palms and grapevines. While these fruits can be used to produce intoxicants, which are prohibited, they also offer wholesome provisions. The coexistence of potential harm and benefit in these fruits serves as a sign and reminder for those who reflect and use their intellect to discern between what is beneficial and what is harmful.""",ومن ثمرات النخيل والأعناب تتخذون منه سكرا ورزقا حسنا إن في ذلك لآية لقوم يعقلون
1968,16,68,"And your Lord inspired to the bee, ""Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct.""","This verse highlights the wisdom and inspiration that Allah has bestowed upon the bee. It is guided by divine revelation to construct its dwellings in the mountains, trees, and other structures. This serves as a reminder of Allah's meticulous care and guidance for all His creatures, even the smallest ones like bees. It also points to the remarkable abilities and instincts that Allah has granted to these creatures, enabling them to build intricate hives and gather sustenance. The verse invites contemplation on the marvels of Allah's creation and the signs of His wisdom present in the natural world around us.",وأوحى ربك إلى النحل أن اتخذي من الجبال بيوتا ومن الشجر ومما يعرشون
1969,16,69,"""Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you]."" There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.","This verse is instructing the believers to partake of the permissible and lawful provisions that Allah has bestowed upon them from various fruits and foods. It then mentions the amazing phenomenon of honey production by bees, which involves the bees consuming nectar from different flowers and fruits, and then producing honey of varying colors within their bodies. This honey contains healing properties beneficial for humans. The verse concludes by stating that this remarkable process is a sign from Allah for those who ponder and reflect upon His creations and the wisdom behind them.",ثم كلي من كل الثمرات فاسلكي سبل ربك ذللا يخرج من بطونها شراب مختلف ألوانه فيه شفاء للناس إن في ذلك لآية لقوم يتفكرون
1970,16,70,"And it is Allah who created you and then will cause you to die, and among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit [old] age so that he will not know, after having had knowledge, a thing. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Knowing and Omnipotent.","This verse reminds us that Allah is the Creator of all beings, and He determines the lifespan of each individual. Some people reach an advanced age where they lose their mental faculties and knowledge, despite having been knowledgeable earlier in life. This serves as a reminder of Allah's complete power and wisdom over the human condition and the cycle of life and death.",والله خلقكم ثم يتوفاكم ومنكم من يرد إلى أرذل العمر لكي لا يعلم بعد علم شيئا إن الله عليم قدير
1971,16,71,And Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal in it. Then is it the favor of Allah they reject?,"This verse highlights Allah's wisdom in distributing wealth and provisions unequally among people as a test. It condemns those who are favored with wealth yet refuse to share it with those under their care or authority, thereby rejecting Allah's favor and being ungrateful.",والله فضل بعضكم على بعض في الرزق فما الذين فضلوا برادي رزقهم على ما ملكت أيمانهم فهم فيه سواء أفبنعمة الله يجحدون
1972,16,72,"And Allah has made for you mates of your own kind, and has made for you, from your mates, sons and grandsons, and has bestowed on you good provisions. Do they then believe in falsehood and deny the favors of Allah?","""Allah has blessed humans with spouses from among their own kind, allowing them to have children and grandchildren through these unions. He has also provided them with sustenance and provisions from pure and lawful sources. Despite these evident blessings and favors from Allah, some people choose to believe in falsehood and reject the favors of their Lord, displaying ingratitude.""",والله جعل لكم من أنفسكم أزواجا وجعل لكم من أزواجكم بنين وحفدة ورزقكم من الطيبات أفبالباطل يؤمنون وبنعمت الله هم يكفرون
1973,16,73,"And they worship besides Allah that which has no control over their provision from the heavens and the earth in the least, nor can they ever have any power.","This verse condemns the practice of idolatry and worshipping false deities besides Allah. It emphasizes that these idols have no power or control over providing sustenance or any benefit from the heavens or the earth. They are utterly helpless and incapable of possessing any real authority or influence. The verse highlights the futility of worshipping anything other than the One True God, Allah, who is the sole Sustainer and Controller of the universe.",ويعبدون من دون الله ما لا يملك لهم رزقا من السماوات والأرض شيئا ولا يستطيعون
1974,16,74,"So do not strike similitudes for Allah. Surely, Allah knows and you do not know.","Allah is beyond human comprehension and analogies. We should not attempt to describe Him using imperfect comparisons or examples, as our knowledge is limited, while Allah's knowledge is perfect and absolute.",فلا تضربوا لله الأمثال إن الله يعلم وأنتم لا تعلمون
1975,16,75,"Allah sets forth a parable: a slave owned by another, unable to do anything of his own accord, and one whom We have provided with good sustenance from Us, so he spends from it secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.","This verse uses a parable to illustrate the difference between those who worship Allah alone and those who associate partners with Him. The slave who is owned and controlled by another represents the idols or false gods that have no power or control over anything. The one whom Allah has provided with good sustenance represents the believers who recognize Allah's favors and spend from what He has provided them, openly and secretly in obedience to Him. The rhetorical question ""Are they equal?"" emphasizes the stark contrast between the two, making it clear that those who worship Allah alone are not equal to those who worship powerless idols or partners besides Allah. The verse concludes by praising Allah and lamenting that most people fail to recognize this truth.",ضرب الله مثلا عبدا مملوكا لا يقدر على شيء ومن رزقناه منا رزقا حسنا فهو ينفق منه سرا وجهرا هل يستوون الحمد لله بل أكثرهم لا يعلمون
1976,16,76,"And Allah presents an example of two men, one of them dumb, unable to do anything, and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is he equal to one who commands justice and is himself on a straight path?","This verse uses an example to illustrate the difference between a believer who follows the truth and guidance, and a disbeliever who is misguided and unable to benefit himself or others. The dumb man who cannot do anything represents the disbeliever who is spiritually deaf and blind, unable to comprehend the truth. He is a burden on his 'master,' meaning he is dependent on others for guidance. Whichever way he is directed, he brings no good. In contrast, the believer commands justice and righteousness, and is himself on the straight path of truth and guidance from Allah.",وضرب الله مثلا رجلين أحدهما أبكم لا يقدر على شيء وهو كل على مولاه أينما يوجهه لا يأت بخير هل يستوي هو ومن يأمر بالعدل وهو على صراط مستقيم
1977,16,77,"And to Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and the command for the Hour is not but like a glance of the eye or even nearer. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute knowledge and power over all that is unseen in the heavens and the earth. It also highlights the suddenness and unpredictability of the coming of the Day of Resurrection, which will occur in the blink of an eye or even sooner, by Allah's command.

1978,16,78,"And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing, and He gave you hearing, vision and hearts so that you may be grateful.","This verse reminds us of Allah's immense favor upon us by bringing us into existence from our mothers' wombs in a state of complete ignorance. He then blessed us with the faculties of hearing, sight, and intellect so that we may use them to acquire knowledge, recognize the truth, and be thankful to Allah for His countless blessings.",والله أخرجكم من بطون أمهاتكم لا تعلمون شيئا وجعل لكم السمع والأبصار والأفئدة لعلكم تشكرون
1979,16,79,"Do they not observe the birds held poised in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except Allah. Verily, in this are signs for people who believe.","The verse highlights Allah's power and wisdom in creating and sustaining the birds in flight. It is a sign for those who believe, pointing to the existence of a Supreme Creator who controls all aspects of the universe. The birds' ability to fly and remain suspended in the air is a manifestation of Allah's might and a reminder of His dominion over all creation.",ألم يروا إلى الطير مسخرات في جو السماء ما يمسكهن إلا الله إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يؤمنون
1980,16,80,"And Allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals, tents, which you find light on the day you travel and the day you encamp; and from their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time.","Allah has provided you with homes to dwell in and feel secure, and also provided you with tents made from animal hides that are lightweight and easy to carry when you travel or settle temporarily.

1983,16,83,They recognize the favor of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers.,"This verse refers to those who acknowledge the blessings and favors bestowed upon them by Allah, yet they ungratefully reject and deny them.

It states that those who disbelieve willingly, without any compulsion, will incur Allah's wrath and a severe punishment.

For such people who are compelled to make a verbal rejection of faith due to extreme circumstances, there is no blame as long as their hearts remain secure in faith.",من كفر بالله من بعد إيمانه إلا من أكره وقلبه مطمئن بالإيمان ولكن من شرح بالكفر صدرا فعليهم غضب من الله ولهم عذاب عظيم
2007,16,107,"That is because they preferred the life of this world over the Hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",This verse explains that the reason for their disbelief and rejection of faith is their preference for the temporary pleasures and comforts of this worldly life over the everlasting rewards of the Hereafter. It also states that Allah does not guide those who willfully reject faith and persist in disbelief.,ذلك بأنهم استحبوا الحياة الدنيا على الآخرة وأن الله لا يهدي القوم الكافرين

The verse serves as a stern warning and a reminder of the grave consequences of disbelief and disobedience.",لا جرم أنهم في الآخرة هم الخاسرون
2010,16,110,"Then indeed, your Lord, to those who emigrated after they had been compelled to renounce their religion, and thereafter struggled hard and persevered patiently - indeed, your Lord, after that, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","Allah is promising forgiveness and mercy to those who were persecuted for their faith, forced to renounce it outwardly while keeping it in their hearts, and then migrated and strove hard in His cause with patience.

When faced with adversity or difficulties, people are quick to invoke evil and curse their circumstances, just as they invoke good and ask for blessings during times of prosperity.

2040,17,12,"And We made the night and day two signs. Then We obliterated the sign of the night and made the sign of day visible, that you may seek bounty from your Lord and know the number of years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything with detailed explanations.","Allah has made the night and day as signs of His power and wisdom. The darkness of night is removed by the light of day, which enables people to pursue their livelihoods and seek sustenance from Allah. The alternation of night and day also helps in determining the passage of time, years, and calculations. This verse highlights Allah's favors upon humanity by creating this natural system and providing detailed explanations of all things in the Qur'an and through the signs in the universe.",وجعلنا الليل والنهار آيتين فمحونا آية الليل وجعلنا آية النهار مبصرة لتبتغوا فضلا من ربكم ولتعلموا عدد السنين والحساب وكل شيء فصلناه تفصيلا

The ""omen"" or ""bird"" fastened upon one's neck is a metaphor for the deeds, good or bad, that one carries throughout life.

And We were not punishing [the people] until We had sent a messenger.,"This verse emphasizes the principle of individual accountability. Each person is responsible for their own choices and actions, and will reap the consequences accordingly. No one can bear the burden or blame of another's sins or wrongdoings. Furthermore, Allah does not punish people without first sending a messenger to guide them and convey His message. This underscores the importance of divine guidance and the mercy of Allah in providing clear guidance before holding people accountable.",من اهتدى فإنما يهتدي لنفسه ومن ضل فإنما يضل عليها ولا تزر وازرة وزر أخرى وما كنا معذبين حتى نبعث رسولا

They seek the ""means"" or ways to draw nearer to Allah, hoping for His mercy and fearing His punishment.

He said, 'Should I prostrate to one You created from clay?'","This verse describes the incident when Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam as a sign of respect and obedience. All the angels obeyed except Iblees (Satan), who arrogantly refused and questioned why he should bow to a being created from clay (i.e. Adam), considering himself superior. This act of disobedience marked the beginning of Iblees' rebellion against Allah and his enmity towards mankind.",وإذ قلنا للملائكة اسجدوا لآدم فسجدوا إلا إبليس قال أأسجد لمن خلقت طينا
2090,17,62,"He (Allah) said, ""What is your opinion of this one whom You have honored above me? If You give me respite until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize his descendants, except a few.""","This verse refers to the dialogue between Allah and Iblis (Satan) regarding Adam. Iblis expresses his intention to misguide Adam's descendants, except for those who remain steadfast in their faith and obedience to Allah. It highlights Iblis' arrogance and his determination to lead humanity astray until the Day of Judgment.",قال أرأيتك هذا الذي كرمت علي لئن أخرتن إلى يوم القيامة لأحتنكن ذريته إلا قليلا
2091,17,63,"He (Allah) said: ""Go, and whoever follows you among them - indeed, Hell will be the recompense of you - an ample recompense.","This verse refers to the punishment that Allah has prepared for Satan and those who follow him. The interpretation is that Allah commanded Satan to go away from His mercy, and whoever follows Satan's path and obeys him, their recompense will be Hell, which is a complete and sufficient punishment for their disobedience and rejection of the truth.",قال اذهب فمن تبعك منهم فإن جهنم جزاؤكم جزاء موفورا
2092,17,64,"And incite whoever you can among them with your voice and recruit against them your cavalry and your infantry and share with them in wealth and children, and promise them. But Satan promises them nothing but delusion.","This verse instructs the believers to use all available means, including speech, military might, and wealth, to confront and challenge the disbelievers and hypocrites. However, it warns that Satan's promises to them are mere deception, leading them astray with false hopes and desires.",واستفزز من استطعت منهم بصوتك وأجلب عليهم بخيلك ورجلك وشاركهم في الأموال والأولاد وعدهم وما يعدهم الشيطان إلا غرورا
2093,17,65,"Verily, over My servants you have no authority, and sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.",Allah is saying that Shaytan (Satan) has no power or authority over the true servants of Allah who are obedient to Him.

2094,17,66,"Your Lord is He Who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of His Bounty. Truly, He is Ever Most Merciful towards you.","This verse highlights Allah's mercy and bounties upon humankind. By enabling ships to sail through the seas, Allah facilitates trade and travel, allowing people to seek His provisions and blessings from different parts of the world. It reminds us to be grateful for Allah's favors and to recognize His compassion towards His creation.",ربكم الذي يزجي لكم الفلك في البحر لتبتغوا من فضله إنه كان بكم رحيما

And ever is man ungrateful.","""When people are faced with difficulties and hardships at sea, they sincerely call upon Allah alone for help and salvation, forgetting all false deities they used to worship. However, when Allah delivers them safely to land, they turn away from Him and become ungrateful, associating others with Allah in worship.""",وإذا مسكم الضر في البحر ضل من تدعون إلا إياه فلما نجاكم إلى البر أعرضتم وكان الإنسان كفورا
2096,17,68,"Do you feel secure that He will not cause a part of the land to swallow you, or send a storm of stones upon you? Then you will find no protector for yourselves.","This verse warns against feeling secure from Allah's punishment. It suggests that one should not feel safe from Allah causing the earth to swallow them or sending a severe punishment upon them, leaving them with no helper or protector.",أفأمنتم أن يخسف بكم جانب البر أو يرسل عليكم حاصبا ثم لا تجدوا لكم وكيلا
2097,17,69,Or do you feel secure that He will not return you to it another time and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your disbelief? Then you would not find for yourselves against Us any advocate.,"Allah is warning the disbelievers not to feel secure from His punishment, as He has the power to return them to the sea and drown them with a violent storm for their disbelief. On the Day of Judgement, they will have no one to plead their case or defend them against Allah's judgment.",أم أمنتم أن يعيدكم فيه تارة أخرى فيرسل عليكم قاصفا من الريح فيغرقكم بما كفرتم ثم لا تجدوا لكم علينا به تبيعا
2098,17,70,"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.","This verse highlights the honor and privilege bestowed upon human beings by Allah. It states that Allah has honored and elevated the status of the children of Adam (humankind) above much of His creation. He has provided them with the means of transportation on land and sea, sustenance from pure and wholesome provisions, and favored them with numerous blessings and abilities that distinguish them from other creatures. This indicates Allah's special mercy and grace towards human beings, as well as the immense responsibility they bear as the honored beings of creation.",ولقد كرمنا بني آدم وحملناهم في البر والبحر ورزقناهم من الطيبات وفضلناهم على كثير ممن خلقنا تفضيلا

Those who are given their record of deeds in their right hand are the successful believers who will read their records with joy, and they will not be wronged in the slightest, not even as much as a thread inside a date seed.",يوم ندعو كل أناس بإمامهم فمن أوتي كتابه بيمينه فأولئك يقرءون كتابهم ولا يظلمون فتيلا
2100,17,72,And whoever is blind in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray in way.,"This verse emphasizes that those who willfully reject the guidance of faith in this world will suffer the consequences of spiritual blindness and being misguided in the Hereafter. Their rejection of truth has deprived them of the ability to see the right path, leaving them lost and astray from Allah's way.",ومن كان في هذه أعمى فهو في الآخرة أعمى وأضل سبيلا
2101,17,73,"And indeed they were about to seduce you away from that which We revealed to you, that you may forge something else against Us; and then they would have taken you as a friend.","This verse warns the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) about the attempts of the disbelievers to misguide him and make him deviate from the revelation he received from Allah. They tried to tempt him to fabricate something other than the Qur'an and attribute it to Allah. However, if he had done so, they would have accepted him as a friend and ally, indicating their true motive was to distort the pure message of Islam.",وإن كادوا ليفتنونك عن الذي أوحينا إليك لتفتري علينا غيره وإذا لاتخذوك خليلا
2102,17,74,"And had We not made you stand firm, you would have inclined a little towards them.","""Had Allah not strengthened your resolve and guided you to the truth, you would have been inclined to compromise with the disbelievers and make concessions to them, even if only slightly, due to their pressure and temptations.""",ولولا أن ثبتناك لقد كدت تركن إليهم شيئا قليلا

It implies that if Allah were to punish them twice in this life and twice in the afterlife, they would have no one to help or protect them from Allah's punishment. The ""twice the life"" could refer to difficulties, hardships, and afflictions faced in this worldly life, while ""twice the death"" could refer to the punishment in the grave and the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The verse emphasizes Allah's absolute power and authority over His creation, and the inability of anyone to escape His justice.",إذا لأذقناك ضعف الحياة وضعف الممات ثم لا تجد لك علينا نصيرا
2104,17,76,"And they were almost going to provoke you to drive you out of the land. But in that case, they would not have remained after you except for a little while.","The interpretation is that the disbelievers tried their utmost to provoke the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and expel him from Makkah through persecution and harassment. However, Allah warns them that if they succeeded in driving him out, their stay in Makkah after his departure would be short-lived, as Allah would eventually destroy them for their disbelief and oppression.",وإن كادوا ليستفزونك من الأرض ليخرجوك منها وإذا لا يلبثون خلافك إلا قليلا
2105,17,77,"This is Our way which We have indeed followed with Our messengers before you, and you will not find any change in Our way.","This verse affirms that Allah's way of dealing with His messengers and their nations is consistent and unchanging. He has established a pattern and tradition (sunnah) that He follows with all His messengers, and this sunnah will not be altered or changed. The verse reassures the Prophet Muhammad that he is treading the same path as the previous messengers, facing similar challenges and opposition from their people. It emphasizes the continuity and uniformity of Allah's guidance and His unwavering support for His messengers.",سنة من قد أرسلنا قبلك من رسلنا ولا تجد لسنتنا تحويلا
2106,17,78,"Establish prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night, and the recitation of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed.","This verse emphasizes the importance of performing the prescribed prayers at their appointed times. The ""decline of the sun"" refers to the afternoon prayer, while ""the darkness of the night"" refers to the evening prayer. The ""recitation of dawn"" is the morning prayer, which is described as being ""witnessed"" by the angels or by nature itself.",أقم الصلاة لدلوك الشمس إلى غسق الليل وقرآن الفجر إن قرآن الفجر كان مشهودا
2107,17,79,"And in the night, arise from sleep for Tahajjud (late-night prayer) - for you a supererogatory (prayer) so that your Lord may raise you to a praised station.","This verse encourages the believers to perform the voluntary late-night prayer called Tahajjud. It suggests that by doing so, Allah may elevate the person to a praised and honorable position on the Day of Judgment.

2110,17,82,"And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.","This verse highlights the healing and merciful nature of the Qur'an for believers, while indicating that it only increases the loss and misguidance of those who persist in wrongdoing and disbelief. The Qur'an is a source of spiritual nourishment, guidance, and cure for the souls of those with faith, but for the arrogant and stubborn disbelievers, it serves to further their deviation and loss.",وننزل من القرآن ما هو شفاء ورحمة للمؤمنين ولا يزيد الظالمين إلا خسارا
2111,17,83,"And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and becomes distant; but when evil touches him, he is ever despairing.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and impatience of human beings. When Allah bestows His favors and blessings upon a person, instead of being grateful, he turns away arrogantly and distances himself from Allah. However, when faced with difficulties or harm, he becomes despondent and loses hope in Allah's mercy. This shows the weakness of human nature and the need to develop gratitude, patience, and trust in Allah during both good and bad times.",وإذا أنعمنا على الإنسان أعرض ونأى بجانبه وإذا مسه الشر كان يئوسا
2112,17,84,"Say, 'Everyone works according to their way, but your Lord knows best who is truly guided.'","This verse emphasizes that each person is responsible for their own actions and beliefs, and that Allah is the ultimate judge of who is rightly guided. It encourages people to focus on their own spiritual path and leave the judgment of others to Allah, who has perfect knowledge of who is following the straight path.

2113,17,85,"And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the soul. Say, 'The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And you have not been given of knowledge except a little.'","This verse indicates that the nature of the soul is a profound and complex matter that is known only to Allah. It is part of the realm of the unseen that humans have been granted little knowledge about. The interpretation suggests that we should be humble and acknowledge the limits of our understanding regarding metaphysical realities like the soul, and submit to Allah's infinite wisdom and knowledge.",ويسألونك عن الروح قل الروح من أمر ربي وما أوتيتم من العلم إلا قليلا
2114,17,86,"And if We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you, then you would find no protector for yourself against Us.","This verse indicates that the revelation of the Qur'an and the prophethood of Muhammad are by the will and grace of Allah. It warns that if Allah willed, He could take away the revelation, leaving the Prophet without any support or helper against Allah's will. This emphasizes the absolute power and authority of Allah over His creation and the complete dependence of the Prophet and all humans on Allah's mercy and sustenance.",ولئن شئنا لنذهبن بالذي أوحينا إليك ثم لا تجد لك به علينا وكيلا
2115,17,87,"But for the mercy from your Lord. Verily, His Grace unto you is ever great.","""This verse indicates that whatever blessings, success or good a person achieves in this life is solely by the grace and mercy of Allah. One should never become arrogant or attribute their achievements to themselves, for Allah's favor and bounties upon His servants are immense and beyond measure.""",إلا رحمة من ربك إن فضله كان عليك كبيرا
2116,17,88,"Say, ""If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.""","This verse emphasizes the inimitable and miraculous nature of the Qur'an. It challenges all of humanity and the jinn (supernatural beings) to collectively attempt to produce a book like the Qur'an, but declares that they would utterly fail in doing so, even if they assisted and supported one another. This highlights the divine origin of the Qur'an and its superiority over human and jinn capabilities, as it is the Word of Allah revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).",قل لئن اجتمعت الإنس والجن على أن يأتوا بمثل هذا القرآن لا يأتون بمثله ولو كان بعضهم لبعض ظهيرا
2117,17,89,"And We have certainly set forth for the people in this Qur'an every kind of example, but most of the people refused [anything] except disbelief.","This verse highlights the comprehensive nature of the Qur'an, which contains various examples, parables, and lessons for humanity. However, despite the clear guidance provided, most people stubbornly reject it and persist in their disbelief and ingratitude towards Allah's favors.",ولقد صرفنا للناس في هذا القرآن من كل مثل فأبى أكثر الناس إلا كفورا
2118,17,90,"And they say, 'We will not believe in you until you make a spring gush forth for us from the earth.'","The disbelievers were making unreasonable demands from the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, as proof of his prophethood. They were asking him to perform a miracle by causing a spring to gush forth from the earth, which is beyond human capability. This verse highlights their stubborn rejection of the truth and their insistence on demanding impossible signs, despite the clear evidence and proofs presented to them.",وقالوا لن نؤمن لك حتى تفجر لنا من الأرض ينبوعا
2119,17,91,Or you have a garden of palm trees and grapevines and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly?,"This verse is posing a rhetorical question to the disbelievers, challenging them to create a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and rivers gushing forth abundantly, if they doubt Allah's ability to create such wonders. It highlights Allah's immense power as the Creator and emphasizes that the disbelievers cannot match His creative abilities.",أو تكون لك جنة من نخيل وعنب فتفجر الأنهار خلالها تفجيرا
2120,17,92,"Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or you bring Allah and the angels before us face to face.","This verse is a challenge to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from the disbelievers, demanding him to perform miracles as proof of his prophethood. They mockingly ask him to either cause the sky to fall upon them in pieces, or to bring Allah and the angels physically before them. The verse highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers in demanding tangible evidence, despite the clear signs and proofs already presented to them through the Qur'an and the message of Islam.",أو تسقط السماء كما زعمت علينا كسفا أو تأتي بالله والملائكة قبيلا
2121,17,93,"Or you have a house adorned with gold, or you ascend into the sky. And we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down for us a book that we may read. Say, ""Exalted is my Lord! Was I ever but a human messenger?""","Cette interprétation souligne l'incrédulité des mécréants envers le Prophète Mohammed. Ils exigeaient des miracles extravagants comme avoir une maison en or ou monter au ciel, sinon ils ne croiraient pas en lui. Dieu ordonne au Prophète de répondre qu'il n'est qu'un messager humain envoyé par Dieu, et que seul Dieu est digne de louange et d'adoration.",أو يكون لك بيت من زخرف أو ترقى في السماء ولن نؤمن لرقيك حتى تنزل علينا كتابا نقرؤه قل سبحان ربي هل كنت إلا بشرا رسولا
2122,17,94,"And what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, 'Has Allah sent a human being as a messenger?'","This verse highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of those who rejected faith when the clear guidance of Islam was presented to them. Their only objection was that the messenger sent by Allah was a human being like themselves, not an angel or a being of a higher form. This shows their flawed reasoning and lack of understanding that Allah chooses messengers from among humans so that they can relate to and guide their fellow human beings effectively.",وما منع الناس أن يؤمنوا إذ جاءهم الهدى إلا أن قالوا أبعث الله بشرا رسولا
2123,17,95,"Say, 'If there were angels walking on earth, We would have sent down an angel from heaven as a messenger.'","This verse emphasizes the importance of the human messengers that Allah has chosen to convey His message. If angels were meant to live on earth, then Allah would have sent an angelic messenger. However, since humans inhabit the earth, Allah has chosen human messengers who can relate to and guide their fellow humans more effectively.",قل لو كان في الأرض ملائكة يمشون مطمئنين لنزلنا عليهم من السماء ملكا رسولا
2124,17,96,"Say, 'Sufficient is Allah as a witness between me and you. Indeed He is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.'","This verse emphasizes Allah's perfect knowledge of His servants and their actions. He is a witness to everything that happens, and nothing is hidden from Him. Therefore, one should rely on Allah's testimony rather than seeking the approval or validation of others. It also serves as a reminder to be mindful of one's actions, as Allah is fully aware of them.",قل كفى بالله شهيدا بيني وبينكم إنه كان بعباده خبيرا بصيرا
2125,17,97,"And whomever Allah guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whomever He sends astray - you will never find for them protectors besides Him, and We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection [fallen] on their faces - blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell; every time it subsided We increase for them the blaze.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute sovereignty over guidance and misguidance. Those guided by Allah are truly guided, while those misguided have no protectors besides Him. On the Day of Judgement, the misguided will be gathered blind, deaf, and mute, unable to perceive reality. Their ultimate abode is Hellfire, where the blazing fire will continually intensify whenever it temporarily subsides.",ومن يهد الله فهو المهتد ومن يضلل فلن تجد لهم أولياء من دونه ونحشرهم يوم القيامة على وجوههم عميا وبكما وصما مأواهم جهنم كلما خبت زدناهم سعيرا

They mocked the idea of being resurrected after their bones had decayed, considering it impossible. The interpretation is that their disbelief and mockery of Allah's signs and revelations will be met with a punishment or recompense on the Day of Judgment. Their denial of resurrection stems from their limited understanding and inability to comprehend Allah's infinite power to recreate them anew.",ذلك جزاؤهم بأنهم كفروا بآياتنا وقالوا أإذا كنا عظاما ورفاتا أإنا لمبعوثون خلقا جديدا
2127,17,99,"Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the like of them? And He has appointed for them a term, there is no doubt about it. Yet the wrongdoers persist in disbelief.","This verse emphasizes Allah's power to resurrect and re-create human beings on the Day of Judgment, just as He created the heavens and the earth. It highlights that Allah has set an appointed time for the resurrection, which is certain to occur. However, the wrongdoers stubbornly reject this truth and persist in disbelief and ingratitude towards Allah's signs and revelations.",أولم يروا أن الله الذي خلق السماوات والأرض قادر على أن يخلق مثلهم وجعل لهم أجلا لا ريب فيه فأبى الظالمون إلا كفورا
2128,17,100,"Say, 'If you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my Lord, you would then withhold out of fear of spending. And man has ever been stingy.'","This verse emphasizes that human beings are inherently stingy and would withhold spending even if they possessed the treasures of Allah's mercy, out of fear of depletion. It highlights the miserly nature of man and his lack of trust in Allah's infinite bounties.",قل لو أنتم تملكون خزائن رحمة ربي إذا لأمسكتم خشية الإنفاق وكان الإنسان قتورا
2129,17,101,"And We did certainly give Moses nine evident signs, so ask the Children of Israel [about] when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, 'Indeed I think, O Moses, that you are effected by magic.'","This verse refers to the nine miracles or signs that Allah gave to Prophet Moses to prove his prophethood and divine mission. It then instructs the Prophet Muhammad to ask the Children of Israel about the time when Moses came to them with these clear signs, and Pharaoh accused him of being under the influence of magic or sorcery due to his inability to comprehend or accept the truth.",ولقد آتينا موسى تسع آيات بينات فاسأل بني إسرائيل إذ جاءهم فقال له فرعون إني لأظنك يا موسى مسحورا
2130,17,102,"He said: ""Assuredly you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as enlightening eye-openers, and I think you are one utterly destroyed, O Pharaoh!""","This verse indicates that the miracles and signs brought by Moses were clear proofs from the One True God, the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Moses is telling Pharaoh that he is clearly doomed and destroyed because of his arrogance and rejection of the truth.",قال لقد علمت ما أنزل هؤلاء إلا رب السماوات والأرض بصائر وإني لأظنك يا فرعون مثبورا
2131,17,103,"And he intended to drive them out of the land, but We drowned him and those with him, all together.","Allah is describing the arrogance and tyranny of Pharaoh when he intended to persecute and expel the Children of Israel from Egypt. However, Allah punished him by drowning him and his soldiers in the sea when they pursued Moses and the Israelites. This verse highlights Allah's power to protect the oppressed and punish the oppressors.",فأراد أن يستفزهم من الأرض فأغرقناه ومن معه جميعا
2132,17,104,"And We said after him to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell in the land, and when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We shall bring you forth in one gathering.'","The interpretation of this verse is that Allah instructed the Children of Israel to inhabit the land of Palestine after the time of Prophet Moses. However, when the Day of Resurrection arrives, Allah will gather them all together from wherever they are, regardless of their dispersed locations, to account for their deeds.",وقلنا من بعده لبني إسرائيل اسكنوا الأرض فإذا جاء وعد الآخرة جئنا بكم لفيفا
2133,17,105,"And with the truth We have sent it down, and with the truth it has descended. And We have not sent you except as a bearer of good tidings and a warner.","Allah sent down the Qur'an with the truth, and it descended from Him with the truth. The Prophet Muhammad was sent as a bearer of good tidings for those who believe and follow the truth, and as a warner for those who disbelieve and deviate from the truth. His mission was to convey the message of guidance and the consequences of accepting or rejecting it.",وبالحق أنزلناه وبالحق نزل وما أرسلناك إلا مبشرا ونذيرا

Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it - when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration,""","This verse encourages belief in the Qur'an and affirms its divine origin. It states that those who have true knowledge from previous scriptures recognize the truth of the Qur'an when it is recited to them, causing them to prostrate out of reverence and submission to God.",قل آمنوا به أو لا تؤمنوا إن الذين أوتوا العلم من قبله إذا يتلى عليهم يخرون للأذقان سجدا

And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way.","This verse teaches us to call upon Allah using any of His beautiful names, as they all refer to the One God. It also guides us to maintain a moderate tone in our prayers, neither excessively loud nor excessively quiet, but to find a middle way that is respectful and focused.",قل ادعوا الله أو ادعوا الرحمن أيا ما تدعوا فله الأسماء الحسنى ولا تجهر بصلاتك ولا تخافت بها وابتغ بين ذلك سبيلا

And let no one be aware of you.'","Allah revived the People of the Cave after their long slumber so that they could engage in a discussion and question one another about the duration of their stay in the cave. One of them asked how long they had remained there, and the others replied that it seemed like a day or part of a day. They acknowledged that Allah knows best how long they had actually stayed. They decided to send one of them to the city with some money to purchase the purest food available, instructing him to be cautious and discreet, so that no one would become aware of their presence.",وكذلك بعثناهم ليتساءلوا بينهم قال قائل منهم كم لبثتم قالوا لبثنا يوما أو بعض يوم قالوا ربكم أعلم بما لبثتم فابعثوا أحدكم بورقكم هذه إلى المدينة فلينظر أيها أزكى طعاما فليأتكم برزق منه وليتلطف ولا يشعرن بكم أحدا

2160,18,21,"And similarly, We revived them so that they would know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour, when they were disputing among themselves about their affair.

Therefore, one should always say 'If Allah wills' when making plans for the future.",ولا تقولن لشيء إني فاعل ذلك غدا

This symbolizes the temporary nature of worldly possessions and the ultimate triumph of faith over disbelief.",فعسى ربي أن يؤتين خيرا من جنتك ويرسل عليها حسبانا من السماء فتصبح صعيدا زلقا

He is the most generous in rewarding those who obey Him and follow His guidance. Additionally, He is the best to determine the ultimate outcome or consequence of one's actions in the Hereafter. This highlights the importance of submitting to Allah's authority, obeying His commands, and trusting in His wisdom and justice regarding the rewards and consequences in this life and the next.",هنالك الولاية لله الحق هو خير ثوابا وخير عقبا

Just as rain causes plants to grow and flourish, only to wither and be scattered by the winds, so too is the life of this world - it appears vibrant and alluring, but ultimately fades and perishes.

Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.","This verse reminds us of the story of Satan's disobedience when he refused to prostrate before Adam, despite Allah's command. It warns against taking Satan and his followers as allies, as they are sworn enemies of humankind. The verse emphasizes that choosing to ally with evil forces is a wretched exchange for the wrongdoers.",وإذ قلنا للملائكة اسجدوا لآدم فسجدوا إلا إبليس كان من الجن ففسق عن أمر ربه أفتتخذونه وذريته أولياء من دوني وهم لكم عدو بئس للظالمين بدلا

So they said, 'This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot.'","The verse refers to the incident when the Israelites, in the absence of Moses, demanded that a statue be made for them to worship. The calf statue was created by collecting their ornaments and casting them into a mould, resulting in a physical form that produced a sound. The Israelites mistakenly attributed divinity to this inanimate object, claiming it to be their god and the god of Moses, whom they accused of forgetting or neglecting them.",فأخرج لهم عجلا جسدا له خوار فقالوا هذا إلهكم وإله موسى فنسي
2436,20,89,"Do they not see that it cannot return speech to them, nor can it cause them any harm or benefit?","This verse questions the idolaters' belief in powerless idols that cannot speak, harm, or benefit them in any way.

2437,20,90,"And indeed, Harun had already said to them beforehand: 'O my people! You are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order.'","In this verse, Aaron (Harun) is advising his people not to be misled by the worship of the calf idol, which was just a test from Allah. He reminds them that Allah is the Most Merciful, and that they should follow his guidance and obey his commands instead of succumbing to this trial.",ولقد قال لهم هارون من قبل يا قوم إنما فتنتم به وإن ربكم الرحمن فاتبعوني وأطيعوا أمري
2438,20,91,"They said, 'We will not cease being devoted to it until Moses returns to us.'","The interpretation of this verse is that the Israelites were determined to continue worshipping the calf idol until Moses returned to them, despite his instructions to worship only Allah. This shows their stubbornness and lack of faith, as they quickly turned to idolatry in the absence of their prophet.",قالوا لن نبرح عليه عاكفين حتى يرجع إلينا موسى
2439,20,92,He (Moses) said: 'O Aaron! What prevented you when you saw them going astray?',"In this verse, Allah mentions the conversation between Prophet Moses and his brother Prophet Aaron regarding the worship of the calf by the Children of Israel in Moses' absence.

2443,20,96,"He said, 'I have seen what they have not seen, so I took a handful from the traces of the Messenger and cast it away, and thus my soul enticed me.'","This verse could be interpreted as someone claiming to have gained spiritual insight or knowledge that others have not attained. However, instead of preserving and cherishing this knowledge, they rejected and discarded it, allowing their ego or desires to lead them astray. The phrase ""traces of the Messenger"" suggests a connection to the teachings or legacy of a religious figure, which the person initially embraced but then abandoned due to their own temptations or self-deception.",قال بصرت بما لم يبصروا به فقبضت قبضة من أثر الرسول فنبذتها وكذلك سولت لي نفسي

And look at your 'god' to which you remained obedient.

2450,20,103,"They will whisper among themselves, 'You remained not but ten (days).'","This verse suggests that those who were in a state of unawareness or oblivion will whisper among themselves, realizing that the time they spent in that state felt like a mere ten days, even though it may have been much longer.

2451,20,104,"We know best what they say when the most devoted of them in way says, 'You have not remained but a day.'","This verse refers to the disbelievers who denied the concept of resurrection and life after death.

2739,23,67,"Being arrogant, you spend the night in revelry","This verse condemns the arrogant and haughty behavior of those who indulge in sinful and wasteful activities at night, spending their time in revelry and disobedience instead of worshipping Allah and being mindful of Him.

If the truth were to conform to people's desires and inclinations, it would lead to corruption and chaos in the heavens, the earth, and among all creatures.

2754,23,82,"They say, ""When we have become dust and bones, shall we indeed be resurrected anew?""","This verse expresses the disbelief and skepticism of the deniers regarding the concept of resurrection after death.

Guidance is ultimately a gift from Allah, and He bestows it upon those who sincerely seek it and have a pure heart and intention.",لقد أنزلنا آيات مبينات والله يهدي من يشاء إلى صراط مستقيم
2837,24,47,"And they say, 'We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey,' then a party of them turns away after that. And those are not believers.","This verse criticizes the hypocrites who outwardly profess faith in Allah and the Messenger, but their actions contradict their claims. It highlights the importance of consistency between one's words and deeds. True belief requires obedience and steadfastness, not merely verbal proclamations that are later abandoned. The verse emphasizes that those who turn away from obedience after claiming belief are not truly believers.",ويقولون آمنا بالله وبالرسول وأطعنا ثم يتولى فريق منهم من بعد ذلك وما أولئك بالمؤمنين
2838,24,48,"And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, a party of them turns away in aversion.","This verse refers to the attitude of some people who refuse to accept the judgment of Allah and His Messenger when disputes arise among them. They turn away arrogantly, rejecting the divine guidance and authority, preferring their own desires or man-made laws over the teachings of Islam. This behavior reflects a lack of faith and submission to the ultimate source of truth and justice.",وإذا دعوا إلى الله ورسوله ليحكم بينهم إذا فريق منهم معرضون
2839,24,49,"And if they are in the right, they come to him in humble obedience.",إذا كان الحق مع الآخرين، فإنهم يأتون إلى النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم منقادين خاضعين، لأنهم يعلمون أنه يحكم بالحق والعدل. فالمؤمنون الصادقون لا يتعصبون لآرائهم إذا ثبت لهم الحق، بل يخضعون له ويقبلونه من غير تردد.,وإن يكن لهم الحق يأتوا إليه مذعنين
2840,24,50,"Is it that there is disease in their hearts, or do they entertain doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger may be unjust towards them? Nay, it is they themselves who are the wrongdoers.","This verse questions the motives and state of those who oppose the truth. It implies that their rejection stems from either spiritual sickness in their hearts, doubts about the truth, or a fear that Allah and His Messenger might treat them unjustly, which is an absurd notion. The verse concludes by stating that it is they themselves who are the wrongdoers by opposing the truth without valid justification.",أفي قلوبهم مرض أم ارتابوا أم يخافون أن يحيف الله عليهم ورسوله بل أولئك هم الظالمون
2841,24,51,"The only statement of the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, is that they say: 'We hear and we obey.' And such are the successful.","This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience and submission to Allah and His Messenger. The true believers, when called upon to refer to the judgment of Allah and His Messenger, respond with complete acceptance and obedience, saying ""We hear and we obey."" This attitude of humility and compliance is a sign of their faith and the key to their success and prosperity in this life and the Hereafter.",إنما كان قول المؤمنين إذا دعوا إلى الله ورسوله ليحكم بينهم أن يقولوا سمعنا وأطعنا وأولئك هم المفلحون
2842,24,52,"And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful ones.","This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to Allah and His Messenger, having fear and consciousness of Allah, and being mindful of one's duties towards Him. Those who fulfill these requirements are promised success and triumph in this life and the Hereafter. The verse highlights that true success lies in submission to the divine commands and living a righteous life in accordance with the teachings of Islam.",ومن يطع الله ورسوله ويخش الله ويتقه فأولئك هم الفائزون
2843,24,53,"And they swore by Allah their most binding oaths that if you ordered them, they would certainly go forth. Say, ""Do not swear. Obedience is known. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do.""","The interpretation is that some hypocrites swore solemn oaths to the Prophet that if he commanded them to go to battle, they would obey. However, Allah instructs the Prophet to tell them not to swear such oaths, as true obedience should be rendered without the need for swearing. Allah is fully aware of their actions and intentions, and they cannot deceive Him with false oaths.",وأقسموا بالله جهد أيمانهم لئن أمرتهم ليخرجن قل لا تقسموا طاعة معروفة إن الله خبير بما تعملون
2844,24,54,"Say, ""Obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away - then upon him is only that with which he has been charged, and upon you is that with which you have been charged. And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. And there is not upon the Messenger except the clear notification.""","This verse emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah and His Messenger. It states that if people turn away from obedience, the Messenger is not responsible for their misguidance, as his duty is only to convey the message clearly. However, if they obey, they will be guided to the right path. The verse highlights the Messenger's role as a conveyor of the message, and the responsibility lies with the people to accept or reject it.",قل أطيعوا الله وأطيعوا الرسول فإن تولوا فإنما عليه ما حمل وعليكم ما حملتم وإن تطيعوه تهتدوا وما على الرسول إلا البلاغ المبين
2845,24,55,"Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieved after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient.","This verse promises the believers that if they have faith and do good deeds, Allah will grant them authority and power on the earth, just as He granted it to the believers before them. He will establish their religion of Islam firmly and replace their fear with security, allowing them to worship Allah alone without associating any partners with Him. However, those who reject faith after receiving this promise will be considered disobedient sinners.",وعد الله الذين آمنوا منكم وعملوا الصالحات ليستخلفنهم في الأرض كما استخلف الذين من قبلهم وليمكنن لهم دينهم الذي ارتضى لهم وليبدلنهم من بعد خوفهم أمنا يعبدونني لا يشركون بي شيئا ومن كفر بعد ذلك فأولئك هم الفاسقون

Que ceux que vous possédez de vos mains et ceux parmi vous qui n'ont pas atteint la puberté, vous demandent permission à trois moments : avant la prière de l'aube, quand vous ôtez vos vêtements de l'après-midi, et après la prière du coucher. Trois moments de nudité pour vous. Après cela, il n'y a aucun mal ni pour vous ni pour eux, à ce qu'ils aillent et viennent auprès de vous, les uns auprès des autres. Ainsi Dieu vous explique Ses versets, et Dieu est Omniscient et Sage.","Cette verse souligne l'importance de préserver l'intimité et la pudeur au sein de la famille musulmane. Elle établit des règles spécifiques pour les esclaves et les enfants mineurs, leur demandant de demander la permission avant d'entrer dans les chambres à certains moments de la journée où les gens sont susceptibles d'être nus ou partiellement nus. Cela vise à protéger la dignité et la vie privée de tous les membres de la famille. La verse souligne également la sagesse divine derrière ces règles, qui visent à promouvoir la décence et le respect mutuel.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا ليستأذنكم الذين ملكت أيمانكم والذين لم يبلغوا الحلم منكم ثلاث مرات من قبل صلاة الفجر وحين تضعون ثيابكم من الظهيرة ومن بعد صلاة العشاء ثلاث عورات لكم ليس عليكم ولا عليهم جناح بعدهن طوافون عليكم بعضكم على بعض كذلك يبين الله لكم الآيات والله عليم حكيم

Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise.","This verse emphasizes the importance of modesty and privacy in Islam. When children reach the age of puberty, they are required to seek permission before entering private spaces, just as adults do. This teaches them to respect boundaries and maintain dignity. The verse highlights that Allah provides clear guidance through His revelations, and He is All-Knowing and All-Wise in His commandments.",وإذا بلغ الأطفال منكم الحلم فليستأذنوا كما استأذن الذين من قبلهم كذلك يبين الله لكم آياته والله عليم حكيم

But to remain modest is better for them, and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.","This verse addresses elderly women who have passed the age of marriage and childbearing. It exempts them from the strict dress code required for younger women, allowing them to ""put aside their outer garments"" without being considered immodest. However, it encourages them to maintain modesty as it is better for them. The verse highlights Allah's knowledge of all circumstances and His ability to hear and understand the needs of different groups of people.",والقواعد من النساء اللاتي لا يرجون نكاحا فليس عليهن جناح أن يضعن ثيابهن غير متبرجات بزينة وأن يستعففن خير لهن والله سميع عليم

It states that there is no sin upon the blind, lame, or ill for not adhering to certain etiquettes or practices that may be difficult for them due to their condition. It also permits eating from the houses of close relatives without needing explicit permission. The verse encourages greeting others with peace when entering homes, as this is a blessed practice ordained by Allah. The purpose is to provide clarity on these matters so that people may understand and follow the ordinances properly.",ليس على الأعمى حرج ولا على الأعرج حرج ولا على المريض حرج ولا على أنفسكم أن تأكلوا من بيوتكم أو بيوت آبائكم أو بيوت أمهاتكم أو بيوت إخوانكم أو بيوت أخواتكم أو بيوت أعمامكم أو بيوت عماتكم أو بيوت أخوالكم أو بيوت خالاتكم أو ما ملكتم مفاتحه أو صديقكم ليس عليكم جناح أن تأكلوا جميعا أو أشتاتا فإذا دخلتم بيوتا فسلموا على أنفسكم تحية من عند الله مباركة طيبة كذلك يبين الله لكم الآيات لعلكم تعقلون
2852,24,62,"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him for a matter of common interest, they do not depart until they have asked his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission, [O Muhammad] - those are the ones who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for something of their affairs, then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience and respect towards the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). True believers are those who not only believe in Allah and the Prophet, but also seek his permission before leaving when they are gathered for a matter of collective interest. It encourages seeking the Prophet's approval and guidance in important matters, and highlights the need to ask for forgiveness from Allah. The verse promotes unity, discipline, and reverence within the Muslim community.",إنما المؤمنون الذين آمنوا بالله ورسوله وإذا كانوا معه على أمر جامع لم يذهبوا حتى يستأذنوه إن الذين يستأذنونك أولئك الذين يؤمنون بالله ورسوله فإذا استأذنوك لبعض شأنهم فأذن لمن شئت منهم واستغفر لهم الله إن الله غفور رحيم

So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet's order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment.",Do not address the Prophet in the same manner you address one another. Show him due respect. Allah knows those who slip away covertly from his gatherings. Those who disobey the Prophet's commands should fear trials and a severe punishment from Allah.,لا تجعلوا دعاء الرسول بينكم كدعاء بعضكم بعضا قد يعلم الله الذين يتسللون منكم لواذا فليحذر الذين يخالفون عن أمره أن تصيبهم فتنة أو يصيبهم عذاب أليم

And the Day they are returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is Knowing of all things.","This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth, and His complete knowledge of all that we do. It reminds us that on the Day of Judgment, we will be held accountable for our actions, and Allah will inform us of everything we have done, as He is All-Knowing and nothing escapes His knowledge.",ألا إن لله ما في السماوات والأرض قد يعلم ما أنتم عليه ويوم يرجعون إليه فينبئهم بما عملوا والله بكل شيء عليم

It states that He is the sole Sovereign of the heavens and the earth, and He has no son or partner in His Dominion. He is the Creator of all things, and He has determined and measured everything with perfect wisdom and precision. This verse negates any notion of polytheism or the association of partners with Allah.",الذي له ملك السماوات والأرض ولم يتخذ ولدا ولم يكن له شريك في الملك وخلق كل شيء فقدره تقديرا
2857,25,3,"And they have taken besides Him gods which do not create anything while they themselves are created, and they do not possess for themselves any harm or benefit, nor do they possess [ability for] death or life or resurrection.","This verse condemns the practice of idolatry and worshipping false deities besides Allah. It highlights the utter powerlessness of these idols, which are mere objects incapable of creating anything, benefiting or harming anyone, or controlling life, death, or resurrection. The interpretation emphasizes the futility of worshipping such powerless entities instead of the One True God, Allah, who is the Creator and Sustainer of all existence.",واتخذوا من دونه آلهة لا يخلقون شيئا وهم يخلقون ولا يملكون لأنفسهم ضرا ولا نفعا ولا يملكون موتا ولا حياة ولا نشورا
2858,25,4,"And those who disbelieved say, 'This is not but a falsehood he invented, and another people assisted him in it.' But they have committed an injustice and a lie.","The disbelievers accused the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of fabricating the Qur'an and claimed that he received help from others in doing so. However, this accusation is unjust and a clear lie, as the Qur'an is the Word of Allah revealed to the Prophet through the angel Gabriel. Their rejection stems from their arrogance and unwillingness to accept the truth.",وقال الذين كفروا إن هذا إلا إفك افتراه وأعانه عليه قوم آخرون فقد جاءوا ظلما وزورا
2859,25,5,"And they say, '[These are but] legends of the former peoples, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and evening.'","The disbelievers accused the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of fabricating the Qur'an by writing down ancient tales and fables. They claimed that he did not receive divine revelation, but rather that the Qur'an was dictated to him by others in the morning and evening. This accusation was a clear rejection of the divine origin of the Qur'an and an attempt to discredit the Prophet's message.",وقالوا أساطير الأولين اكتتبها فهي تملى عليه بكرة وأصيلا

The verse instills a sense of reverence for the divine source of the Qur'an and encourages trust in its guidance, as it emanates from the One who possesses complete knowledge of all affairs.",قل أنزله الذي يعلم السر في السماوات والأرض إنه كان غفورا رحيما
2861,25,7,"And they say, ""What is this messenger that he eats food and walks in the markets? Why has there not been sent down to him an angel to be a warner with him?""","""The disbelievers mockingly questioned how an ordinary man who ate food and walked in the markets could be a messenger from God.

And the wrongdoers say, 'You follow not but a man affected by magic.'","The disbelievers mockingly demanded that the Prophet be given a treasure or a garden to eat from, implying that only then would they believe in his message. They dismissed him as merely a man under the influence of magic or sorcery.",أو يلقى إليه كنز أو تكون له جنة يأكل منها وقال الظالمون إن تتبعون إلا رجلا مسحورا
2863,25,9,"See how they strike similitudes for you, but they have gone astray, so they cannot find a way.","This verse criticizes those who reject the message of Islam and mock it by using flawed analogies and comparisons.

2864,25,10,"Blessed is He who, if He wills, will assign you better than that - gardens under which rivers flow - and will assign for you palaces.",This verse is interpreted as a promise from Allah to the believers of an even greater reward in the Hereafter than what they have in this world. The gardens with rivers flowing underneath and palaces are metaphors for the eternal bliss and luxury that await the righteous in Paradise. It highlights Allah's infinite power and generosity in rewarding His obedient servants with something far superior to the temporary pleasures of this life.,تبارك الذي إن شاء جعل لك خيرا من ذلك جنات تجري من تحتها الأنهار ويجعل لك قصورا
2865,25,11,"Nay, they denied the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour, We have prepared a blazing Fire.","This verse is a warning for those who reject the reality of the Day of Resurrection.

2866,25,12,"If they see them from a distant place, they will hear their raging and sighing.","This verse is describing the intense anger and frustration of the disbelievers towards the believers on the Day of Judgment. Even from a distance, the disbelievers will be able to hear the furious raging and sighing sounds made by the believers as they witness the disbelievers being punished for their rejection of faith. It portrays the disbelievers' helplessness and regret on that Day, as they are forced to face the consequences of their disbelief.",إذا رأتهم من مكان بعيد سمعوا لها تغيظا وزفيرا
2867,25,13,"And when they are thrown into a constricted place therein, bound in chains, they will cry out thereupon for destruction","This verse describes the miserable state of the disbelievers in Hell.

They were arrogant within themselves and [became] insolent with great insolence.","This verse criticizes those who arrogantly demand tangible proof of God's existence, such as the descent of angels or seeing God directly. Their arrogance stems from their limited human perspective and inability to comprehend the divine wisdom behind the unseen realities. It highlights the spiritual blindness caused by pride and self-conceit, leading to a rejection of faith without valid justification.",وقال الذين لا يرجون لقاءنا لولا أنزل علينا الملائكة أو نرى ربنا لقد استكبروا في أنفسهم وعتوا عتوا كبيرا

Nay, but most of them know not.","This verse is highlighting the uniqueness and power of Allah as the sole Creator. It describes various aspects of Allah's creation, such as the earth being a stable dwelling place, the presence of rivers, mountains, and the barrier between salt and fresh waters. These signs of Allah's might are then contrasted with the notion of any other deity besides Him, rejecting it outright and attributing such ignorance to most people's lack of knowledge.",أمن جعل الأرض قرارا وجعل خلالها أنهارا وجعل لها رواسي وجعل بين البحرين حاجزا أإله مع الله بل أكثرهم لا يعلمون

They said, 'We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.'","This verse describes the arrival of Prophet Moses in Midian after fleeing Egypt. He found a group of people watering their flocks, and two women waiting to water their animals after the shepherds had finished. The women explained that their elderly father could not water the animals himself, so they had to wait their turn. This situation revealed the difficulties faced by the weak and vulnerable in society, and foreshadowed Moses' subsequent assistance to the women.",ولما ورد ماء مدين وجد عليه أمة من الناس يسقون ووجد من دونهم امرأتين تذودان قال ما خطبكما قالتا لا نسقي حتى يصدر الرعاء وأبونا شيخ كبير

Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me.'","This verse refers to the story of Prophet Musa (Moses) when he arrived in Madyan after fleeing from Egypt. He helped two women water their flocks, and then sought shade and supplicated to Allah, acknowledging his need for Allah's provision and bounties.",فسقى لهما ثم تولى إلى الظل فقال رب إني لما أنزلت إلي من خير فقير
3276,28,25,"Then there came to him one of the two women, walking with shyness. She said, 'Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.' So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, 'Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.'","This verse narrates the story of Prophet Moses after he fled from Egypt. One of the two women he had helped by watering their flocks came to him shyly, inviting him to meet her father, who wanted to reward him for his kind act. When Moses met the father and told him what had happened, the father reassured him, saying he need not fear, for he had escaped from the oppressive people of Egypt.",فجاءته إحداهما تمشي على استحياء قالت إن أبي يدعوك ليجزيك أجر ما سقيت لنا فلما جاءه وقص عليه القصص قال لا تخف نجوت من القوم الظالمين
3277,28,26,"One of the two women said, 'O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.'","This verse highlights the importance of hiring capable and trustworthy individuals. The woman advises her father to hire the man (Moses) because he possesses the qualities of strength and trustworthiness, which are essential for carrying out tasks effectively and responsibly. The interpretation emphasizes the value of competence and integrity in any professional or personal endeavor.",قالت إحداهما يا أبت استأجره إن خير من استأجرت القوي الأمين
3278,28,27,"He said: 'I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will. I do not wish to be hard on you, God willing, you will find me one of the righteous.'","This verse relates to the story of Prophet Moses when he sought employment with a righteous man. The man offered to marry one of his daughters to Moses in return for serving him for eight years, or optionally ten years if Moses chose to do so voluntarily. The man reassured Moses that he did not wish to overburden him, and that God willing, Moses would find him to be a righteous person to work with.",قال إني أريد أن أنكحك إحدى ابنتي هاتين على أن تأجرني ثماني حجج فإن أتممت عشرا فمن عندك وما أريد أن أشق عليك ستجدني إن شاء الله من الصالحين

Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice done to me, and Allah is a Witness over what we say.'","This verse refers to a situation where two parties have agreed upon certain terms or conditions. The interpretation is that if either party fulfills their part of the agreement, the other party cannot accuse them of any wrongdoing or injustice. Additionally, it emphasizes that Allah is the Witness over their agreement and their words.",قال ذلك بيني وبينك أيما الأجلين قضيت فلا عدوان علي والله على ما نقول وكيل

He said to his family, ""Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I can bring you from there some information or a burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.""","This verse describes the beginning of Moses' encounter with God at the burning bush. After completing his term of service with his father-in-law, Moses was traveling with his family when he noticed a fire in the distance near Mount Sinai. He told his family to stay behind while he went to investigate the fire, hoping to bring back information or a burning ember to warm themselves. This marked the start of Moses' prophetic mission and his communication with God.",فلما قضى موسى الأجل وسار بأهله آنس من جانب الطور نارا قال لأهله امكثوا إني آنست نارا لعلي آتيكم منها بخبر أو جذوة من النار لعلكم تصطلون

He was called by Allah from the right side of the valley, which is described as the ""blessed ground."" The voice came from the tree, addressing Moses and declaring that Allah is the Lord of the worlds. This event marked the beginning of Moses' prophethood and his mission to confront Pharaoh and deliver the Children of Israel from bondage.",فلما أتاها نودي من شاطئ الواد الأيمن في البقعة المباركة من الشجرة أن يا موسى إني أنا الله رب العالمين

Indeed, you are of those who are secure.""","""This verse describes the encounter between Moses and God at the sacred valley of Tuwa. When Moses threw down his staff as commanded by God, it miraculously transformed into a slithering snake, causing Moses to flee in fear initially. However, God reassured him, calling him to approach without fear, as he was among those who were secure and protected by God.""",وأن ألق عصاك فلما رآها تهتز كأنها جان ولى مدبرا ولم يعقب يا موسى أقبل ولا تخف إنك من الآمنين

These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Truly, they are an evil-living people.","This verse instructs Prophet Moses to perform two miracles as signs from God to Pharaoh and his people. The first is to insert his hand into his garment and then withdraw it, and it will come out shining white without any disease or blemish. The second is to draw his wing or arm close to his body to overcome his fear. These two miracles are evidence of Moses' prophethood from God to Pharaoh and his chiefs, who were transgressing people.",اسلك يدك في جيبك تخرج بيضاء من غير سوء واضمم إليك جناحك من الرهب فذانك برهانان من ربك إلى فرعون وملئه إنهم كانوا قوما فاسقين

I have killed a person among them, and I fear that they will kill me.'",This verse refers to the incident when Moses killed an Egyptian man who was fighting with an Israelite. Moses expresses his fear of being killed in retaliation by the Egyptians for this act. It highlights Moses' human vulnerability and his reliance on Allah's protection and guidance.,قال رب إني قتلت منهم نفسا فأخاف أن يقتلون
3285,28,34,"And my brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than me, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.","The interpretation is that Moses (peace be upon him) is asking Allah to send his brother Aaron with him as a support and helper in conveying the message to Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Moses fears that they may reject or deny his message, so he wants Aaron, who is more eloquent in speech, to accompany him and confirm what he says.",وأخي هارون هو أفصح مني لسانا فأرسله معي ردءا يصدقني إني أخاف أن يكذبون

They dismissed the clear evidence as mere magic or trickery, and claimed that it contradicted the beliefs and traditions passed down from their ancestors. Their arrogance and unwillingness to accept the truth blinded them from recognizing the divine signs.""",فلما جاءهم موسى بآياتنا بينات قالوا ما هذا إلا سحر مفترى وما سمعنا بهذا في آبائنا الأولين
3288,28,37,"And Moses said, 'My Lord is most knowing of who has brought guidance from Him and to whom the final home will be. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.'","In this verse, Moses affirms his trust in Allah's knowledge and wisdom. He acknowledges that Allah knows best who has brought true guidance from Him and who will ultimately attain success in the Hereafter. Moses emphasizes that the wrongdoers, those who reject faith and do evil deeds, will not achieve true success or salvation. This verse highlights the importance of faith, righteousness, and reliance on Allah's guidance to attain ultimate success and a favorable outcome in the eternal life to come.",وقال موسى ربي أعلم بمن جاء بالهدى من عنده ومن تكون له عاقبة الدار إنه لا يفلح الظالمون

3290,28,39,"And he and his hosts behaved insolently in the land without right, and thought that they would never be returned to Us.","This verse refers to Pharaoh and his people who arrogantly rejected the message of God and oppressed the Israelites in the land of Egypt. They believed that they would not be held accountable for their actions and would not return to God for judgment. This interpretation highlights Pharaoh's arrogance, oppression, and denial of the Hereafter.",واستكبر هو وجنوده في الأرض بغير الحق وظنوا أنهم إلينا لا يرجعون
3291,28,40,So We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers.,"The interpretation of this verse is that Allah punished Pharaoh and his army for their oppression and disbelief by drowning them in the sea. This serves as a lesson and warning for those who commit wrongdoing and oppression, as their ultimate fate will be a terrible punishment from Allah.",فأخذناه وجنوده فنبذناهم في اليم فانظر كيف كان عاقبة الظالمين
3292,28,41,"And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.","This verse refers to the leaders and influential figures who misguide people and call them towards disbelief and evil deeds. They are described as ""leaders inviting to the Fire"" because their actions and influence lead people away from the straight path and towards the punishment of Hellfire. On the Day of Resurrection, these misleading leaders will find no helper or supporter to save them from Allah's judgment.",وجعلناهم أئمة يدعون إلى النار ويوم القيامة لا ينصرون
3293,28,42,"And We caused them to be followed in this world by a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the disgraced.","This verse indicates that Allah has cursed those who disbelieved and rejected the truth in this worldly life, depriving them of guidance and blessings. Additionally, on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among those who are humiliated and disgraced due to their disbelief and disobedience to Allah's commands.",وأتبعناهم في هذه الدنيا لعنة ويوم القيامة هم من المقبوحين
3294,28,43,And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture after We had destroyed the former generations as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that perhaps they would be reminded.,"This verse refers to the revelation of the Torah to Prophet Moses after Allah had destroyed the previous nations who rejected His messengers. The Torah was given as a source of enlightenment, guidance, and mercy for mankind, in the hope that they would take heed and remember Allah's teachings and avoid the fate of those who came before them and were punished for their disbelief and disobedience.",ولقد آتينا موسى الكتاب من بعد ما أهلكنا القرون الأولى بصائر للناس وهدى ورحمة لعلهم يتذكرون
3295,28,44,"And you were not on the western side [of the Mount] when We ordained for Moses the command, and you were not among the witnesses.","This verse indicates that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not present at the time when Allah gave the commandments to Prophet Moses on Mount Sinai. It emphasizes that the Prophet Muhammad's knowledge of these events came through divine revelation, not from being an eyewitness. This highlights the miraculous nature of the Qur'an and the Prophet's prophethood, as he had knowledge of past events that he could not have known otherwise.",وما كنت بجانب الغربي إذ قضينا إلى موسى الأمر وما كنت من الشاهدين
3296,28,45,"But We have produced [numerous] generations, and prolonged for them was their life span. And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of messengers].","This verse suggests that Allah has created many generations before and allowed them to live long lives. However, the Prophet Muhammad was not present among the people of Madyan to recite Allah's revelations to them. Instead, Allah sent messengers to convey His message. The verse implies that the Prophet's role was not limited to a specific time or place, but rather, Allah has continuously sent messengers to guide humanity throughout different eras and civilizations.",ولكنا أنشأنا قرونا فتطاول عليهم العمر وما كنت ثاويا في أهل مدين تتلو عليهم آياتنا ولكنا كنا مرسلين
3297,28,46,"Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when We called (to Moses). Yet (art thou sent) as Mercy from thy Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receive admonition.","""This verse indicates that the Prophet Muhammad was not present at Mount Sinai when God called upon Moses. Rather, he was sent as a mercy from God to warn a people who had not received any warner before him, so that they may be reminded of God's teachings and guidance.""",وما كنت بجانب الطور إذ نادينا ولكن رحمة من ربك لتنذر قوما ما أتاهم من نذير من قبلك لعلهم يتذكرون
3298,28,47,"And if not that a great calamity would afflict them for what their hands have sent forth, they would say, 'Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?'","This verse suggests that if Allah did not punish people for their misdeeds and sins through calamities and hardships, they would continue in their disbelief and wrongdoing. However, when faced with difficulties, they would wish that a messenger had been sent to guide them so that they could follow Allah's teachings and become believers. The verse highlights Allah's mercy in sending messengers and revelations to guide humanity, and His wisdom in allowing adversities to befall people as a means of reminding them of their need for faith and guidance.",ولولا أن تصيبهم مصيبة بما قدمت أيديهم فيقولوا ربنا لولا أرسلت إلينا رسولا فنتبع آياتك ونكون من المؤمنين

They rejected it, questioning why he was not given miracles like those given to Prophet Moses. This shows their stubbornness and arrogance, as they had already rejected the previous revelations given to Moses. They accused Moses and Muhammad of being 'two magicians supporting each other' and declared their disbelief in both prophets and their messages.",فلما جاءهم الحق من عندنا قالوا لولا أوتي مثل ما أوتي موسى أولم يكفروا بما أوتي موسى من قبل قالوا سحران تظاهرا وقالوا إنا بكل كافرون

If they claim to be truthful in their rejection, they should present such a Book. However, since no scripture can surpass the Qur'an in its divine wisdom and guidance, this challenge exposes the falsehood of their stance and establishes the truth of the Qur'an as the final revelation from Allah.",قل فأتوا بكتاب من عند الله هو أهدى منهما أتبعه إن كنتم صادقين
3301,28,50,"But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their own desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.","This verse emphasizes the importance of following the guidance of Allah rather than one's own desires and whims. It warns that those who reject the message of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are merely following their own desires without any guidance from Allah. The verse states that such people are misguided and astray, as they have deviated from the straight path. It also highlights that Allah does not guide those who are wrongdoers and oppressors, as they have chosen to reject His guidance and follow their own desires instead.",فإن لم يستجيبوا لك فاعلم أنما يتبعون أهواءهم ومن أضل ممن اتبع هواه بغير هدى من الله إن الله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين
3302,28,51,And We have certainly conveyed to them the Word so that they may remember.,"This verse suggests that Allah has sent clear guidance and reminders through His revelations and messengers, so that people may be mindful of their purpose in life and accountable for their actions. It emphasizes that humans have been provided with the necessary knowledge and teachings to guide them towards the right path, and it is up to them to reflect upon these teachings and follow them.",ولقد وصلنا لهم القول لعلهم يتذكرون
3303,28,52,Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they are believers in it.,"This verse refers to the People of the Book, such as Jews and Christians, who were given previous scriptures like the Torah and the Gospel. It states that those who were given the divine scriptures before the Qur'an, truly believe in the Qur'an because it confirms the fundamental teachings found in their own scriptures.",الذين آتيناهم الكتاب من قبله هم به يؤمنون

Indeed, we were Muslims before it.'","This verse refers to the believers who recognize the truth of the Qur'an when it is recited to them. They affirm their faith in it, acknowledging that it is the truth from their Lord, and they declare that they had already submitted to God's will even before the revelation of the Qur'an. This shows their sincerity and readiness to accept the divine guidance.",وإذا يتلى عليهم قالوا آمنا به إنه الحق من ربنا إنا كنا من قبله مسلمين
3305,28,54,Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and repel evil with good and spend out of what We have provided them.,"This verse promises a double reward to those who patiently endure difficulties and trials, respond to harm with kindness and good deeds, and spend from the provisions Allah has granted them in charitable ways. It encourages perseverance, forgiveness, good character and generosity, which will be greatly rewarded by Allah.",أولئك يؤتون أجرهم مرتين بما صبروا ويدرءون بالحسنة السيئة ومما رزقناهم ينفقون

Peace will be upon you; we do not seek the ignorant.""","""This verse encourages the believers to avoid engaging with vain or immoral speech and behavior. Instead of responding in kind, they should politely disengage and focus on their own actions and responsibilities. They should maintain peace and not seek interactions with those who embrace ignorance and immorality.""",وإذا سمعوا اللغو أعرضوا عنه وقالوا لنا أعمالنا ولكم أعمالكم سلام عليكم لا نبتغي الجاهلين
3307,28,56,"Indeed, you do not guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.","This verse emphasizes that guidance is solely from Allah. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cannot guide whomever he wishes, even his loved ones, because guidance comes from Allah's will and wisdom. Allah alone knows best who is truly guided and worthy of His guidance.",إنك لا تهدي من أحببت ولكن الله يهدي من يشاء وهو أعلم بالمهتدين
3308,28,57,"And they say, 'If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched from our land.'

However, Allah reminds them of the secure sanctuary (Makkah) He has established for them, where provisions from all kinds of fruits are brought as sustenance from Him. Yet, most of them fail to recognize this blessing and remain ungrateful.",وقالوا إن نتبع الهدى معك نتخطف من أرضنا أولم نمكن لهم حرما آمنا يجبى إليه ثمرات كل شيء رزقا من لدنا ولكن أكثرهم لا يعلمون
3309,28,58,"And how many a town have We destroyed for their insolent way of life? Those are their dwellings, which have hardly been inhabited after them except a little. And it is We who were the inheritors.","This verse serves as a warning against arrogance, heedlessness, and indulgence in worldly pleasures. It reminds us that Allah has destroyed many nations who lived in luxury and transgressed against His commands. Their dwellings lie in ruin, a testimony to their downfall. Only a few have inhabited those places after them. Ultimately, Allah is the Inheritor of all things, and nothing belongs to anyone eternally except Him.",وكم أهلكنا من قرية بطرت معيشتها فتلك مساكنهم لم تسكن من بعدهم إلا قليلا وكنا نحن الوارثين
3310,28,59,And your Lord would not destroy the towns until He had raised a messenger in their mother town to recite Our verses to them. And We would not destroy the towns except when their people were wrongdoers.,Allah does not punish or destroy a nation without first sending a messenger to guide them and warn them of the consequences of their wrongdoing. The destruction of nations is a result of their own injustice and rejection of the truth after being clearly shown the right path. Allah's justice dictates that no one is punished without being given a fair chance to repent and mend their ways.,وما كان ربك مهلك القرى حتى يبعث في أمها رسولا يتلو عليهم آياتنا وما كنا مهلكي القرى إلا وأهلها ظالمون

Do you not then reason?",This verse reminds us that the worldly pleasures and possessions we have are temporary and fleeting. The true and everlasting joy lies with Allah. It encourages us to use our intellect and reason to recognize the transient nature of this life and strive for the eternal bliss promised by Allah in the Hereafter.,وما أوتيتم من شيء فمتاع الحياة الدنيا وزينتها وما عند الله خير وأبقى أفلا تعقلون
3312,28,61,"Is one to whom We have promised a good promise which he will obtain, like one whom We have provided with the enjoyments of worldly life, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be among those brought forth?","This verse draws a contrast between the believers who have been promised a good reward in the Hereafter, and the disbelievers who are only given temporary enjoyments in this worldly life. The interpretation is that the one who believes in God and His promises will attain a far greater and everlasting reward, while the one who disbelieves and indulges only in worldly pleasures will be brought forth on the Day of Judgment to face accountability.",أفمن وعدناه وعدا حسنا فهو لاقيه كمن متعناه متاع الحياة الدنيا ثم هو يوم القيامة من المحضرين
3313,28,62,"And the Day He will call them and say, 'Where are My 'partners' that you used to claim?'",This verse refers to the Day of Judgment when Allah will call the idolaters and polytheists and question them about the false deities they associated with Him.

It was not us that they worshipped.'","This verse refers to the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers and misguided people will try to shift blame away from themselves. The leaders or instigators of misguidance will claim innocence by saying that they did not force the misguided ones to worship them, rather it was the misguided ones themselves who chose to worship the leaders instead of Allah. This shows the state of denial and attempt to avoid accountability on that Day.",قال الذين حق عليهم القول ربنا هؤلاء الذين أغوينا أغويناهم كما غوينا تبرأنا إليك ما كانوا إيانا يعبدون

(And it will be said): ""If only they had been guided!""","This verse highlights the futility of associating partners with Allah. On the Day of Judgment, the idolaters will be commanded to call upon their so-called partners or deities for help, but they will receive no response. This will expose the falsehood of their beliefs and the powerlessness of their supposed partners. They will then witness the punishment, realizing too late the grave error of their ways and wishing they had been rightly guided.",وقيل ادعوا شركاءكم فدعوهم فلم يستجيبوا لهم ورأوا العذاب لو أنهم كانوا يهتدون
3316,28,65,"And the Day when He will call them and say, 'What was the answer you gave to the messengers?'","On the Day of Judgment, Allah will call all people and question them about how they responded to the messengers and prophets who were sent to guide them.

It suggests that those who sincerely repent from their sins, have faith in God, and perform good deeds have the potential to attain success and salvation. The phrase ""it may be"" indicates hope and possibility, encouraging people to strive for righteousness while acknowledging that their ultimate fate rests with God's mercy and judgment.",فأما من تاب وآمن وعمل صالحا فعسى أن يكون من المفلحين

Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him.,"This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and freedom in His creation and choices. He creates whatever He wills without any limitations or external influences. The choice and determination belong solely to Him, not to His creation. This affirms Allah's transcendence and His being far above any partners or equals that people associate with Him.",وربك يخلق ما يشاء ويختار ما كان لهم الخيرة سبحان الله وتعالى عما يشركون

It emphasizes that all praise and gratitude belongs to Him in this world and the Hereafter.

Then will you not hear?""","This verse invites people to ponder over the absolute power and control of Allah over the universe. It asks them to reflect on what would happen if Allah decided to make the night continuous and prolonged until the Day of Resurrection. In such a scenario, no other deity or being would be able to bring them light or illumination. This verse emphasizes Allah's uniqueness as the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Controller of the entire universe, and questions the polytheists' belief in other deities besides Allah. It urges them to listen, reflect, and recognize the truth of Allah's Oneness.",قل أرأيتم إن جعل الله عليكم الليل سرمدا إلى يوم القيامة من إله غير الله يأتيكم بضياء أفلا تسمعون

It questions what other deity could bring them light (day) if Allah were to make the night continuous until the Day of Resurrection.

3325,28,74,"And the Day He will call them and say, ""Where are My 'partners' that you used to claim?""","This verse refers to the Day of Judgment when Allah will question the idolaters about the false deities they associated with Him. He will ask them where those alleged ""partners"" are, exposing the futility of their polytheistic beliefs and practices. The verse highlights the absurdity of ascribing partners to the One True God and serves as a warning against shirk (associating others with Allah).",ويوم يناديهم فيقول أين شركائي الذين كنتم تزعمون

It tells the story of Qarun, who was given immense wealth by Allah but became arrogant and ungrateful. His people advised him not to be exultant and boastful about his wealth, as Allah does not love those who are arrogant and ungrateful. The verse teaches that true richness lies in faith, humility, and gratitude towards the Almighty, not in material possessions.",إن قارون كان من قوم موسى فبغى عليهم وآتيناه من الكنوز ما إن مفاتحه لتنوء بالعصبة أولي القوة إذ قال له قومه لا تفرح إن الله لا يحب الفرحين

And the criminals will not be asked about their sins.","This verse suggests that wealth and power are temporary and can be taken away at any time by Allah. It warns against arrogance and pride in one's possessions, as true knowledge comes from recognizing Allah's power and sovereignty. The verse also implies that those who commit crimes and sins will ultimately be held accountable by Allah, regardless of their worldly status or wealth.",قال إنما أوتيته على علم عندي أولم يعلم أن الله قد أهلك من قبله من القرون من هو أشد منه قوة وأكثر جمعا ولا يسأل عن ذنوبهم المجرمون

Indeed, he is one of great fortune.'","This verse highlights the arrogance and materialism of Qarun and his people. Despite being blessed with wealth by Allah, Qarun became prideful and ungrateful. The people who were dazzled by his worldly possessions envied him and wished for similar fortune, being blinded by the temporary pleasures of this life and forgetting the eternal rewards of the Hereafter. The verse serves as a reminder to be humble, grateful to Allah, and to focus on the everlasting life after death rather than being consumed by worldly desires.",فخرج على قومه في زينته قال الذين يريدون الحياة الدنيا يا ليت لنا مثل ما أوتي قارون إنه لذو حظ عظيم

It introduces the story of Prophet Shu'ayb who was sent to the people of Madyan to guide them towards monotheism and righteous conduct.",وإلى مدين أخاهم شعيبا فقال يا قوم اعبدوا الله وارجوا اليوم الآخر ولا تعثوا في الأرض مفسدين
3376,29,37,"But they denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they lay prostrate in their home.","This verse refers to the people of Prophet Shu'ayb who rejected his message and warnings.

And Satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path, and they were endowed with insight.","The interpretation of this verse is that Allah destroyed the nations of 'Aad and Thamud, whose ruined dwellings serve as a clear evidence of their destruction. Satan made their evil deeds seem attractive to them, leading them astray from the straight path, despite their intelligence and ability to discern right from wrong.",وعادا وثمود وقد تبين لكم من مساكنهم وزين لهم الشيطان أعمالهم فصدهم عن السبيل وكانوا مستبصرين

Certains ont été frappés par une pluie de pierres, d'autres ont été détruits par un cri puissant, d'autres ont été engloutis par la terre, et d'autres encore se sont noyés. Cependant, Dieu ne les a pas punis injustement, car c'est leur propre transgression et leur refus d'obéir qui ont causé leur punition. Dieu est juste et ne fait de tort à personne, mais ce sont les gens eux-mêmes qui se font du tort en désobéissant à Ses commandements.",فكلا أخذنا بذنبه فمنهم من أرسلنا عليه حاصبا ومنهم من أخذته الصيحة ومنهم من خسفنا به الأرض ومنهم من أغرقنا وما كان الله ليظلمهم ولكن كانوا أنفسهم يظلمون

And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew.","This verse uses a metaphor to highlight the futility of taking allies other than Allah. It likens those who seek protection from other than Allah to a spider that builds a frail home. Just as a spider's web is weak and fragile, seeking allies besides Allah provides no real protection or security. The verse emphasizes that true security and protection can only come from Allah, and relying on anything or anyone else is a vain effort that offers no genuine support or refuge.",مثل الذين اتخذوا من دون الله أولياء كمثل العنكبوت اتخذت بيتا وإن أوهن البيوت لبيت العنكبوت لو كانوا يعلمون
3381,29,42,"Indeed, Allah knows whatever thing they call upon instead of Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","Allah knows the falsehood of what the polytheists worship besides Him, for none has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone.

It emphasizes that the Qur'an was not derived from any previous scripture, nor was it written by the Prophet himself. If he had done so, the disbelievers would have doubted its authenticity, claiming he had written it himself.

3429,30,21,"And among His signs is that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between you. Verily, in that are signs for people who reflect.","This verse highlights the profound wisdom behind the creation of spouses from among humankind itself. It emphasizes that the purpose of this creation is to foster a sense of tranquility, love, and mercy within the marital bond. The verse invites contemplation on the deeper spiritual and emotional connections that exist between spouses, which serve as signs of God's mercy and wisdom for those who ponder upon them.",ومن آياته أن خلق لكم من أنفسكم أزواجا لتسكنوا إليها وجعل بينكم مودة ورحمة إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يتفكرون

Surely in this are signs for those of knowledge.","This verse highlights the diversity and wonders found in Allah's creation as a sign of His power and wisdom. The creation of the heavens and earth, along with the diversity of human languages and skin colors, are presented as evidence of Allah's existence and greatness. This diversity is not random, but a purposeful design meant to encourage contemplation and recognition of the Creator by those who possess knowledge and insight.",ومن آياته خلق السماوات والأرض واختلاف ألسنتكم وألوانكم إن في ذلك لآيات للعالمين

It invites people to reflect on these favors as signs of Allah's wisdom and mercy for those who are attentive and listen to the message.,ومن آياته منامكم بالليل والنهار وابتغاؤكم من فضله إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يسمعون
3432,30,24,"And among His signs is that He shows you the lightning, causing fear and hope, and He sends down water from the sky, giving life thereby to the earth after its death. Indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason.","This verse highlights two of Allah's signs that demonstrate His power and mercy: lightning and rain. The lightning, with its fearsome flashes and thunderous sound, instills a sense of fear and awe in people, reminding them of Allah's might. At the same time, it brings hope for the life-giving rain that follows. The rain, sent down from the sky, revives the earth after it has been dry and lifeless, allowing vegetation to grow and sustaining all living beings. These phenomena are clear signs pointing to the existence and greatness of the Creator for those who use their intellect and contemplate the marvels of Allah's creation.",ومن آياته يريكم البرق خوفا وطمعا وينزل من السماء ماء فيحيي به الأرض بعد موتها إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يعقلون

Then when He calls you with a [single] call from the earth, at once you will come forth.","This verse indicates the absolute power and authority of Allah over the entire universe. The heavens and the earth continue to exist and function perfectly by Allah's command and will. When the Day of Resurrection comes, and Allah calls all human beings with a single call from the earth, they will immediately come out of their graves, obeying His command. This shows that just as Allah has power over creating and sustaining the universe, He also has power over resurrection and gathering all people for judgment.",ومن آياته أن تقوم السماء والأرض بأمره ثم إذا دعاكم دعوة من الأرض إذا أنتم تخرجون
3434,30,26,And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him.,"This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and authority over all creation. Everything in the heavens and the earth, including all creatures, are submissive and obedient to Allah's commands and laws. This implies that nothing occurs without Allah's knowledge and permission, and that He is the sole controller of the universe. The verse instills a sense of humility and reverence towards the Almighty.",وله من في السماوات والأرض كل له قانتون
3435,30,27,"And He is the One Who begins the creation, then He will repeat it, and that is easy for Him. To Him belongs the highest description in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.","This verse affirms Allah's ability to initiate creation and then repeat it, which refers to the resurrection after death. It emphasizes that this process is effortless for Allah. The verse also highlights Allah's sublime attributes, stating that the highest and most perfect descriptions belong to Him in the heavens and the earth. Additionally, it describes Allah as the Almighty, who possesses absolute power, and the All-Wise, whose actions are based on perfect wisdom and knowledge.",وهو الذي يبدأ الخلق ثم يعيده وهو أهون عليه وله المثل الأعلى في السماوات والأرض وهو العزيز الحكيم
3436,30,28,He presents to you a parable from your own selves: Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess who share with you alike in the provision We have bestowed upon you? You hold them equal (in sharing) as you fear one another? Thus do We explain the verses for people who understand.,"Allah presents a parable to make people understand that it is illogical to associate partners with Him. Just as people do not accept partners from among their slaves in the wealth that Allah has provided them, similarly it is irrational to associate partners with Allah in His Lordship and Divinity. The verse emphasizes the Oneness of Allah and the absurdity of associating partners with Him.",ضرب لكم مثلا من أنفسكم هل لكم من ما ملكت أيمانكم من شركاء في ما رزقناكم فأنتم فيه سواء تخافونهم كخيفتكم أنفسكم كذلك نفصل الآيات لقوم يعقلون
3437,30,29,"Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge. Who is there to guide him whom Allah has sent astray? And they will have no helpers.","This verse warns against following one's desires and whims without knowledge or guidance from Allah. It emphasizes that those who persist in wrongdoing and remain heedless of Allah's guidance will be left to stray, with no one to guide them and no supporters to help them. The verse highlights the importance of seeking knowledge, following the truth, and submitting to Allah's guidance to avoid misguidance and spiritual ruin.",بل اتبع الذين ظلموا أهواءهم بغير علم فمن يهدي من أضل الله وما لهم من ناصرين
3438,30,30,"So set your face towards the religion uprightly; the nature made by Allah in which He has created mankind. There is no altering Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know.","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad and the believers to adhere to the pure, upright religion of Islam, which is in accordance with the natural disposition (fitrah) that Allah has instilled in all human beings. This natural disposition is to worship Allah alone and reject all forms of polytheism and idolatry. The verse emphasizes that the religion of Islam is the true and unwavering religion established by Allah, and that most people are unaware of this truth due to their ignorance and misguidance.",فأقم وجهك للدين حنيفا فطرت الله التي فطر الناس عليها لا تبديل لخلق الله ذلك الدين القيم ولكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون
3439,30,31,"Turn to Him in repentance, and fear Him; and establish regular prayers, and do not be among those who join gods with Allah.","This verse calls upon believers to turn to Allah in sincere repentance, to have fear and reverence for Him, and to establish regular prayers. It also warns against associating any partners with Allah, which is the grave sin of shirk.",منيبين إليه واتقوه وأقيموا الصلاة ولا تكونوا من المشركين
3440,30,32,"Among those who have divided their religion and become sects, each party rejoicing in what it has.","This verse criticizes those who divide their religion into sects and groups, each group arrogantly clinging to its own beliefs and practices, rejoicing in their limited understanding without seeking the complete truth. It condemns sectarianism, factionalism, and blind adherence to one's own group while disregarding the unity of faith.",من الذين فرقوا دينهم وكانوا شيعا كل حزب بما لديهم فرحون
3441,30,33,"And when affliction touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord","This verse highlights the fickleness and ingratitude of human beings. When afflicted with hardship or calamity, they sincerely turn to Allah and implore Him alone. However, once Allah bestows His mercy and relieves them of their difficulties, some of them associate partners with Allah by reverting to polytheism or disobedience, instead of remaining grateful and devoted solely to Him.",وإذا مس الناس ضر دعوا ربهم منيبين إليه ثم إذا أذاقهم منه رحمة إذا فريق منهم بربهم يشركون
3442,30,34,"That they should disbelieve in that which We have revealed to them; so enjoy yourselves, for soon you will know.","This verse warns the disbelievers who reject the revelations of Allah. It implies that they should not take pride in their temporary enjoyment of worldly pleasures, for soon they will face the consequences of their disbelief and come to know the reality of what they denied.",ليكفروا بما آتيناهم فتمتعوا فسوف تعلمون
3443,30,35,"Or have We sent down to them an authority, and it speaks of what they used to associate with Him?","Allah is questioning the disbelievers' association of partners with Him. No evidence or authority has been sent down from Allah that justifies their polytheistic beliefs. Their shirk (associating partners with Allah) is based on mere conjecture and whims, without any proof or scriptural support.",أم أنزلنا عليهم سلطانا فهو يتكلم بما كانوا به يشركون
3444,30,36,"And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have sent forth, behold, they are in despair.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and lack of steadfastness of human beings. When Allah bestows His mercy and blessings upon them, they become joyful and happy. However, when they face adversity as a result of their own misdeeds, they immediately lose hope and fall into despair instead of turning to Allah in repentance and seeking His forgiveness.",وإذا أذقنا الناس رحمة فرحوا بها وإن تصبهم سيئة بما قدمت أيديهم إذا هم يقنطون
3445,30,37,"Have they not seen that Allah spreads the provision for whom He wills and restricts it? Verily, in that are signs for a people who believe.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute control over sustenance and provision. He grants abundant provision to whomever He wills and restricts it for whomever He wills, according to His perfect wisdom and justice. This phenomenon serves as a profound sign and evidence of Allah's existence and power for those who truly believe and reflect.",أولم يروا أن الله يبسط الرزق لمن يشاء ويقدر إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يؤمنون
3446,30,38,"So give the relative his right, as well as the poor and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the Countenance of Allah, and it is they who will be successful.","This verse emphasizes the importance of fulfilling the rights of relatives, helping the poor and needy, and being generous towards travelers. It encourages these acts as a means of seeking Allah's pleasure and attaining success in this life and the Hereafter. The interpretation is that true believers should prioritize caring for their families, supporting the less fortunate, and showing hospitality to travelers as a manifestation of their faith and desire to please Allah.",فآت ذا القربى حقه والمسكين وابن السبيل ذلك خير للذين يريدون وجه الله وأولئك هم المفلحون
3447,30,39,"And whatever you give for interest to increase within the wealth of people will not increase with Allah. But what you give in zakah, desiring the countenance of Allah - those are the multipliers.","This verse condemns the practice of usury or interest-based transactions, which unjustly enrich the lender at the expense of the borrower. It states that any wealth gained through interest will not increase in the sight of Allah. However, wealth given as zakah (obligatory charity) with the intention of seeking Allah's pleasure will be multiplied and rewarded manifold.",وما آتيتم من ربا ليربو في أموال الناس فلا يربو عند الله وما آتيتم من زكاة تريدون وجه الله فأولئك هم المضعفون
3448,30,40,"It is Allah Who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, then will give you life again. Is there any of your 'partners' that can do any single one of these things? Glorified and Exalted is He above all that they associate as partners (with Him).","This verse affirms Allah's Oneness and denies any partners to Him. It highlights that Allah alone is the Creator, the Sustainer, the Giver of death, and the Resurrector. None of the so-called partners that the polytheists associate with Allah can perform any of these actions. Allah is glorified and exalted above all that they associate as partners with Him.",الله الذي خلقكم ثم رزقكم ثم يميتكم ثم يحييكم هل من شركائكم من يفعل من ذلكم من شيء سبحانه وتعالى عما يشركون

Allah allows people to experience some of the consequences of their wrongdoings, so that they may realize the error of their ways and return to the right path of preserving the natural balance and avoiding actions that lead to corruption and harm.",ظهر الفساد في البر والبحر بما كسبت أيدي الناس ليذيقهم بعض الذي عملوا لعلهم يرجعون

On that Day they will be separated.,"The verse commands the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and by extension all believers, to dedicate themselves sincerely to the true religion of Islam before the inevitable Day of Judgment arrives, when it will be too late to repent.

3452,30,44,"Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief is upon himself, and whoever does good deeds, they are paving the way for themselves.","This verse emphasizes individual accountability and responsibility.

Then We took retribution from those who committed crimes, and incumbent upon Us was support of the believers.","This verse emphasizes the continuity and universality of Allah's message through His messengers.

And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice","This verse highlights Allah's absolute power and control over the natural phenomena, specifically the wind and rain. It describes the process of how Allah sends the winds that stir up the clouds, spreading them in the sky as He wills. He then fragments the clouds, causing raindrops to emerge from within them. When Allah causes the rain to fall upon whomever He wills from His servants, they rejoice and feel grateful for this blessing from Allah.",الله الذي يرسل الرياح فتثير سحابا فيبسطه في السماء كيف يشاء ويجعله كسفا فترى الودق يخرج من خلاله فإذا أصاب به من يشاء من عباده إذا هم يستبشرون
3457,30,49,"And indeed they were, before the Quran was revealed to them, in grave error.","This verse indicates that before the revelation of the Qur'an, the people were living in a state of misguidance and confusion, devoid of true knowledge and guidance.

3458,30,50,"So observe the effects of the mercy of Allah - how He revives the earth after its death. Indeed, that [same One] will surely revive the dead, and He is over all things competent.","""This verse invites us to reflect on the signs of Allah's power and mercy in reviving the dead earth through the rainfall, which causes plants to grow and life to flourish again.

Their stubbornness and rejection of faith is so deeply rooted that no amount of evidence or miracles would convince them to believe. The verse highlights the obstinacy of the disbelievers and their refusal to accept the truth despite witnessing clear signs from Allah.",ولئن أرسلنا ريحا فرأوه مصفرا لظلوا من بعده يكفرون
3460,30,52,"So verily, you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn away.","This verse teaches that the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, cannot guide those who deliberately turn away from the truth and refuse to listen. Just as a dead person cannot hear, and a deaf person cannot hear the call when they turn away, similarly those who stubbornly reject the message cannot benefit from the Prophet's guidance. It emphasizes the importance of having an open heart and mind to receive the truth.",فإنك لا تسمع الموتى ولا تسمع الصم الدعاء إذا ولوا مدبرين
3461,30,53,"And you are not a guide to the blind away from their misguidance. You can only make hear those who believe in Our verses, so they are Muslims.","Allah is telling the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that he cannot guide those who are blind to the truth and persist in misguidance.

However, even if a clear sign or miracle is presented to the disbelievers, they will still reject it and accuse the believers of being liars or falsifiers.

In such a case, the believers should politely refuse to obey their parents' orders, but continue to treat them with respect and kindness in worldly matters that do not involve disobedience to Allah. The verse also encourages following the path of those who repent and turn back to Allah, as ultimately everyone will return to Him on the Day of Judgment, and He will inform them of their deeds.",وإن جاهداك على أن تشرك بي ما ليس لك به علم فلا تطعهما وصاحبهما في الدنيا معروفا واتبع سبيل من أناب إلي ثم إلي مرجعكم فأنبئكم بما كنتم تعملون

He has subjugated everything in the heavens and the earth for our benefit. Yet, some people argue against Allah's existence and favors without any true knowledge, guidance, or enlightening scripture.

Allah is the Preserver and Watcher over all things, including people's faith and deeds.",وما كان له عليهم من سلطان إلا لنعلم من يؤمن بالآخرة ممن هو منها في شك وربك على كل شيء حفيظ

They do not possess an atom's weight in the heavens or on the earth, nor do they have any share in either, nor does He have any helper from among them.""","This verse emphasizes the utter powerlessness of the false deities that people associate with Allah. It challenges those who worship idols or ascribe partners to Allah to call upon their alleged gods, as they do not possess even an atom's weight of power or authority in the heavens or on the earth. They have no stake or share in the creation or control of the universe. Furthermore, Allah does not have any supporter or helper from among these false gods, as He is the sole Creator and Sustainer of all that exists.",قل ادعوا الذين زعمتم من دون الله لا يملكون مثقال ذرة في السماوات ولا في الأرض وما لهم فيهما من شرك وما له منهم من ظهير

They will say, 'The truth.' And He is the Most High, the Grand.","No one can intercede on behalf of another person on the Day of Resurrection except by Allah's permission. When the fear and terror is removed from the hearts of believers on that Day, they will ask what Allah has decreed. The reply will be that Allah has spoken the truth and commanded justice. He is the Most High, the Supremely Grand and Great, deserving of all praise and obedience.",ولا تنفع الشفاعة عنده إلا لمن أذن له حتى إذا فزع عن قلوبهم قالوا ماذا قال ربكم قالوا الحق وهو العلي الكبير
3629,34,24,"Say, ""Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""Allah. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error.""","This verse challenges the disbelievers to reflect on who is the true provider and sustainer of all life in the heavens and the earth. It is Allah alone who provides sustenance and nourishment to all His creation. The verse then poses two possibilities: either the believers are rightly guided by following Allah's teachings, or the disbelievers are in manifest misguidance by rejecting the truth.",قل من يرزقكم من السماوات والأرض قل الله وإنا أو إياكم لعلى هدى أو في ضلال مبين
3630,34,25,"Say, 'You will not be asked about what we committed, nor will we be asked about what you do.'","This verse emphasizes the principle of individual accountability before God. Each person is responsible for their own actions and will be judged accordingly on the Day of Judgment. Neither group will be questioned about the deeds of the other, as everyone will bear the consequences of their own choices and actions. It highlights the idea that no one can rely on the good deeds of others or shift blame for their misdeeds onto someone else. Ultimately, each soul is accountable for itself.",قل لا تسألون عما أجرمنا ولا نسأل عما تعملون
3631,34,26,"Say, ""Our Lord will bring us together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the All-Knowing Judge.""","This verse is a call for patience and trust in God's ultimate judgment. It reminds us that all disputes will eventually be resolved by God, who knows the truth of every matter. We should not be hasty in judging others or seeking revenge, but rather leave the final judgment to the All-Wise and All-Knowing Lord.",قل يجمع بيننا ربنا ثم يفتح بيننا بالحق وهو الفتاح العليم

However, it affirms that there is no true deity except Allah, the Almighty and the Wise, Who alone deserves worship and has no partners.",قل أروني الذين ألحقتم به شركاء كلا بل هو الله العزيز الحكيم
3633,34,28,And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know.,"""This verse highlights the universal nature of Prophet Muhammad's message and mission. He was sent as a mercy to all of mankind, not just a specific group or nation. His role was to bring glad tidings of salvation and reward for those who believed and followed the divine guidance, and to warn of the consequences of disbelief and disobedience. However, the verse laments that most people remain ignorant of this profound truth and its implications.""",وما أرسلناك إلا كافة للناس بشيرا ونذيرا ولكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون
3634,34,29,"And they say, 'When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?'","This verse refers to the disbelievers who mockingly questioned when the punishment or the Day of Resurrection promised by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) would come to pass, if he was truly truthful in his message. It reflects their arrogance and lack of faith in the divine warnings.",ويقولون متى هذا الوعد إن كنتم صادقين
3635,34,30,"Say, 'For you is the appointment of a Day which you cannot postpone nor advance by a single hour.'","This verse emphasizes the certainty of the Day of Judgment, which no one can delay or hasten. It reminds us that this appointed Day will come without fail, and no one has the power to change its timing, even by a single hour. This highlights the absolute control and power of Allah over all events and reinforces the importance of being prepared for this inevitable Day.",قل لكم ميعاد يوم لا تستأخرون عنه ساعة ولا تستقدمون

But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, refuting each other's word - those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, 'If not for you, we would have been believers.'","This verse highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of the disbelievers, who refuse to believe in the Qur'an and the previous revelations. It also depicts the scene on the Day of Judgment, where the oppressed will blame the arrogant for leading them astray, saying that if it weren't for their influence, they would have believed.",وقال الذين كفروا لن نؤمن بهذا القرآن ولا بالذي بين يديه ولو ترى إذ الظالمون موقوفون عند ربهم يرجع بعضهم إلى بعض القول يقول الذين استضعفوا للذين استكبروا لولا أنتم لكنا مؤمنين

Rather, you yourselves were criminals.""","This verse describes a conversation that will take place on the Day of Judgment between the arrogant and oppressive leaders and their oppressed followers. The leaders will claim innocence, suggesting that they did not turn their followers away from the guidance after it had reached them. Instead, they will blame the followers themselves, accusing them of being criminals who willingly chose to reject the truth.",قال الذين استكبروا للذين استضعفوا أنحن صددناكم عن الهدى بعد إذ جاءكم بل كنتم مجرمين

But they will conceal regret when they see the punishment. And We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be recompensed except for what they used to do?","This verse describes the exchange between the oppressed and the arrogant on the Day of Judgment. The oppressed will blame the arrogant leaders for conspiring day and night to make them disbelieve in Allah and associate partners with Him.

3639,34,34,"And We did not send any warner to a town but its affluent ones said, 'Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers.'","This verse indicates that whenever a Prophet or Messenger was sent to a town or community to warn them and guide them to the truth, the wealthy and affluent people who were leading a luxurious life of indulgence arrogantly rejected the message and declared their disbelief in what the Prophet was preaching. Their attachment to worldly pleasures made them blind to the truth and prevented them from accepting the divine guidance.",وما أرسلنا في قرية من نذير إلا قال مترفوها إنا بما أرسلتم به كافرون

He will then ask the angels rhetorically if it was them that the people used to worship instead of Allah, exposing the falsehood of idol worship and making it clear that the angels were not worthy of worship.",ويوم يحشرهم جميعا ثم يقول للملائكة أهؤلاء إياكم كانوا يعبدون

Nay, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them.'","This verse suggests that the idolaters worshipped jinn (unseen beings) instead of Allah. They attributed their acts of worship to the jinn, believing that the jinn had power and influence over their lives. This shows their deviation from the true worship of the One God and their ignorance in associating partners with Allah.",قالوا سبحانك أنت ولينا من دونهم بل كانوا يعبدون الجن أكثرهم بهم مؤمنون
3647,34,42,"So today none of you will have any power over one another for benefit or harm, and We will say to those who did wrong, 'Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.'","""This verse indicates the complete severance of relationships and transactions on the Day of Judgment.

Despite the clear and undeniable proofs presented in the Qur'anic verses, they dismissed it as mere lies and sorcery, refusing to abandon the pagan beliefs and practices of their forefathers. Their rejection stemmed from a desire to cling to familiar traditions rather than accepting the divine message out of arrogance and closed-mindedness.",وإذا تتلى عليهم آياتنا بينات قالوا ما هذا إلا رجل يريد أن يصدكم عما كان يعبد آباؤكم وقالوا ما هذا إلا إفك مفترى وقال الذين كفروا للحق لما جاءهم إن هذا إلا سحر مبين

My reward is only from Allah, and He is a witness over all things.'","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to convey to the people that he does not seek any worldly reward or compensation from them for conveying the message of Islam.

3654,34,49,"Say, 'The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin anything nor resurrect.'","This verse affirms the absolute truth and supremacy of Islam. It declares that the truth, represented by the message of Islam, has come and prevailed. Falsehood, on the other hand, has no power to initiate or create anything new, nor can it revive or bring back what has become obsolete or extinct. The verse emphasizes the futility and impotence of falsehood in the face of the eternal truth revealed by God.",قل جاء الحق وما يبدئ الباطل وما يعيد
3655,34,50,"Say, 'If I should err, I would only go astray against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and Near.'","This verse emphasizes individual responsibility and accountability before Allah. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is instructed to declare that if he goes astray, the consequences will be upon himself alone. However, if he is guided, it is by the revelation from Allah, Who is All-Hearing and Ever-Near. This highlights the importance of seeking guidance from Allah and following the divine revelation, as well as the principle that each person is accountable for their own choices and actions.",قل إن ضللت فإنما أضل على نفسي وإن اهتديت فبما يوحي إلي ربي إنه سميع قريب
3656,34,51,"And if you could but see when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a position nearby.","This verse describes a terrifying scene on the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers will realize the reality of the Hereafter and their grave mistake in rejecting faith.

3657,34,52,"And they say, 'We believe in it,' but how for them to attain [faith] from a distant place?","This verse criticizes the insincere claim of belief by some people. They claim to believe in the Qur'an, but their actions and attitudes demonstrate that their claimed faith is not genuine. The phrase ""from a distant place"" implies that true faith is far from their reach due to their insincerity and lack of commitment.",وقالوا آمنا به وأنى لهم التناوش من مكان بعيد
3658,34,53,"And they had already disbelieved in it, and they used to cast accusations based on mere conjecture from a far-off place.","This verse refers to the disbelievers who rejected the Qur'an even before it was revealed, and they made baseless accusations against it without any knowledge or evidence, as if they were throwing accusations ""blindly"" from a distant place without understanding the truth.",وقد كفروا به من قبل ويقذفون بالغيب من مكان بعيد
3659,34,54,"And a barrier will be placed between them and what they desire, as was done with the factions that went before them. They were indeed in grave doubt.","This verse indicates that on the Day of Judgment, a barrier will separate the disbelievers from attaining what they desired in this world, just as previous nations who rejected faith were prevented from their desires. They were engulfed in doubts and suspicions regarding the truth, which led them to reject the message of the prophets.",وحيل بينهم وبين ما يشتهون كما فعل بأشياعهم من قبل إنهم كانوا في شك مريب

Some people have their evil actions made appealing to them, causing them to perceive those actions as good. However, Allah guides whom He wills and leaves astray whom He wills. The Prophet is advised not to grieve excessively over those who refuse guidance, as Allah is fully aware of their actions.",أفمن زين له سوء عمله فرآه حسنا فإن الله يضل من يشاء ويهدي من يشاء فلا تذهب نفسك عليهم حسرات إن الله عليم بما يصنعون

This realization should instill humility and gratitude in us towards our Lord, who provides for us despite our utter neediness.",يا أيها الناس أنتم الفقراء إلى الله والله هو الغني الحميد

You can warn only those who fear their Lord unseen and perform the prayer. And whoever purifies himself, purifies himself only for (the benefit of) his own soul. And to Allah is the final return.","This verse emphasizes the principles of individual responsibility and accountability. Each person bears their own burden of sins and good deeds, and cannot transfer or share that burden with others, even if they are close relatives. The warning of the Qur'an is only effective for those who fear Allah in their hearts and establish regular prayer. Purification and righteousness are for one's own spiritual benefit, as everyone will ultimately return to Allah for judgment.",ولا تزر وازرة وزر أخرى وإن تدع مثقلة إلى حملها لا يحمل منه شيء ولو كان ذا قربى إنما تنذر الذين يخشون ربهم بالغيب وأقاموا الصلاة ومن تزكى فإنما يتزكى لنفسه وإلى الله المصير

Indeed, Allah causes to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.","This verse emphasizes that the living and the dead are not equal in their ability to comprehend and respond.

Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, and with the Scriptures, and with the enlightening Book.","If the people reject your message, O Muhammad, do not be distressed, for many messengers before you were also rejected by their people. Those messengers brought clear signs, revealed books, and enlightening scriptures from Allah, yet their people still disbelieved. So, do not be disheartened by those who deny your message, for you are following in the footsteps of the previous prophets.",وإن يكذبوك فقد كذب الذين من قبلهم جاءتهم رسلهم بالبينات وبالزبر وبالكتاب المنير

That is the great bounty.","This verse refers to the inheritance of the divine scripture, which was given to those chosen by Allah from among His servants. It highlights the different responses people have towards this guidance: some wrong themselves by rejecting it, some are moderate in following it, and others are foremost in good deeds by Allah's permission. The last group attains the ""great bounty,"" which is the highest reward and favor from Allah.",ثم أورثنا الكتاب الذين اصطفينا من عبادنا فمنهم ظالم لنفسه ومنهم مقتصد ومنهم سابق بالخيرات بإذن الله ذلك هو الفضل الكبير

Surely in this is a reminder for men of understanding.",هذه الآية الكريمة تشير إلى قدرة الله تعالى وعظمة خلقه، حيث يبين كيف ينزل الماء من السماء ويجعله ينابيع في الأرض، ثم يخرج به النباتات المختلفة الألوان، ثم تذبل هذه النباتات وتصفر، ثم تجف وتتحطم. وفي هذه العملية الدقيقة والمعقدة لدورة الحياة والموت للنباتات دليل واضح على وجود الله وقدرته، وهذا يعتبر تذكيرًا لأولي الألباب والعقول الراجحة.,ألم تر أن الله أنزل من السماء ماء فسلكه ينابيع في الأرض ثم يخرج به زرعا مختلفا ألوانه ثم يهيج فتراه مصفرا ثم يجعله حطاما إن في ذلك لذكرى لأولي الألباب
4079,39,22,Is one whose breast Allah has expanded to [accept] Islam so that he is upon a light from his Lord [like one obstructed]? Then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah. Those are in manifest error.,"This verse contrasts between those whose hearts have been opened and enlightened by Allah to accept Islam, and those whose hearts have hardened and turned away from the remembrance of Allah. The former are guided by the light from their Lord, while the latter are in clear misguidance and error. The interpretation emphasizes the importance of having a receptive heart towards the truth and the dire consequences of hardening one's heart against Allah's remembrance and guidance.",أفمن شرح الله صدره للإسلام فهو على نور من ربه فويل للقاسية قلوبهم من ذكر الله أولئك في ضلال مبين
4080,39,23,"Allah has sent down the best statement, a consistent Book wherein is reiteration. The skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills. And one for whom Allah does not guide - there is no guide at all for him.","The Qur'an is described as the ""best statement"" because it is the word of God, free from any flaws or contradictions. Its consistent nature and reiteration of key themes and teachings make it a unique book that has a profound spiritual impact on believers. When the verses are recited, the believers feel a sense of awe and fear of God, causing their skins to shiver. However, this is followed by a sense of tranquility and softening of their hearts as they remember God and His guidance. The verse emphasizes that the Qur'an is a source of guidance from Allah, but only those whom He wills to be guided will truly benefit from it. Those who are not guided by Allah have no other means of finding the right path.",الله نزل أحسن الحديث كتابا متشابها مثاني تقشعر منه جلود الذين يخشون ربهم ثم تلين جلودهم وقلوبهم إلى ذكر الله ذلك هدى الله يهدي به من يشاء ومن يضلل الله فما له من هاد
4081,39,24,"Is one who is saved from the awful doom on the Day of Resurrection by his face better, or he who is commanded: ""Taste the punishment because of what you used to earn?""","This verse contrasts the fate of the righteous believers who will be saved from punishment on the Day of Resurrection by the light on their faces, with the fate of the wrongdoers who will be commanded to taste the punishment they earned due to their disbelief and evil deeds. It emphasizes the importance of faith and righteous conduct to attain salvation and avoid the severe punishment on the Day of Judgment.",أفمن يتقي بوجهه سوء العذاب يوم القيامة وقيل للظالمين ذوقوا ما كنتم تكسبون
4082,39,25,"Those before them denied, and the punishment came upon them whence they perceived not.","This verse warns those who reject faith and persist in disbelief that they will face a severe punishment, just like the previous nations who denied the truth and were consequently destroyed. The punishment will come unexpectedly, from a source they did not anticipate or realize. It serves as a reminder of the grave consequences of denying God's signs and messengers.",كذب الذين من قبلهم فأتاهم العذاب من حيث لا يشعرون
4083,39,26,"So Allah made them taste disgrace in the present life, and the punishment of the Hereafter will be greater, if they only knew.","Allah disgraced and humiliated the disbelievers in this worldly life as a consequence of their rejection of faith and righteous deeds. However, the punishment that awaits them in the Hereafter is far more severe and unbearable, if only they had realized and understood the gravity of their actions.",فأذاقهم الله الخزي في الحياة الدنيا ولعذاب الآخرة أكبر لو كانوا يعلمون
4084,39,27,And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example - that they might remember.,"Allah has provided numerous examples, metaphors, and parables in the Qur'an to aid people's understanding and encourage them to reflect upon its teachings. These examples serve as reminders and illustrations to help people comprehend the profound truths and wisdom contained within the divine revelation.",ولقد ضربنا للناس في هذا القرآن من كل مثل لعلهم يتذكرون
4085,39,28,"An Arabic Qur'an, free from any deviance, that they may become righteous.","This verse indicates that the Qur'an has been revealed in the clear and eloquent Arabic language, free from any crookedness, ambiguity or contradiction. Its purpose is to guide people towards righteousness and piety by following its teachings and commandments.",قرآنا عربيا غير ذي عوج لعلهم يتقون
4086,39,29,"Allah presents an example: a man enslaved by partners at odds, and another man belonging entirely to one man - are they equal in comparison? All praise is due to Allah; but most of them do not know.","This verse uses an analogy to illustrate the concept of associating partners with Allah (shirk) versus pure monotheism (tawheed). The first man represents those who associate partners with Allah, like idols or other deities, leading to conflicts and disunity. The second man represents the one who worships Allah alone, with complete submission and harmony. The rhetorical question ""Are they equal in comparison?"" emphasizes that these two conditions are vastly different. The verse concludes by praising Allah and acknowledging that most people fail to recognize the truth of tawheed.",ضرب الله مثلا رجلا فيه شركاء متشاكسون ورجلا سلما لرجل هل يستويان مثلا الحمد لله بل أكثرهم لا يعلمون
4087,39,30,"Indeed, you will die, and indeed, they will die.","This verse emphasizes the inevitability of death for all human beings, including the Prophet Muhammad and those who opposed him. It reminds us that death is a universal reality that no one can escape, regardless of their status or beliefs. The verse serves as a reminder of our mortality and the temporary nature of this worldly life, encouraging us to focus on the eternal life in the Hereafter.",إنك ميت وإنهم ميتون
4088,39,31,"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be disputing before your Lord.","On the Day of Judgment, people will argue and dispute before Allah regarding their beliefs, actions, and the truth they rejected in this world. This verse highlights the futility of such disputes on that Day, as the truth will become evident, and everyone will be held accountable for their choices and deeds.",ثم إنكم يوم القيامة عند ربكم تختصمون
4089,39,32,So who is more unjust than one who lies about Allah and denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a residence for the disbelievers?,This verse condemns those who reject the truth and lie about Allah after being presented with clear evidence and guidance. It emphasizes the grave injustice of such an act and warns that the ultimate abode for such disbelievers is Hell. The verse highlights the severity of denying the truth and rejecting faith after receiving clear signs and proofs from Allah.,فمن أظلم ممن كذب على الله وكذب بالصدق إذ جاءه أليس في جهنم مثوى للكافرين
4090,39,33,And he who has brought the truth and [they who] have believed in it - those are the righteous.,"This verse highlights the virtues of those who uphold the truth and have faith in it.

The interpretation emphasizes the importance of sincerity, truthfulness, and righteousness in one's beliefs and actions.",والذي جاء بالصدق وصدق به أولئك هم المتقون
4091,39,34,For them is whatever they desire with their Lord. That is the reward for the doers of good.,"This verse promises that the believers who do righteous deeds will attain whatever they desire in Paradise, by the grace and bounty of Allah.

The fulfillment of all their desires signifies the ultimate bliss and satisfaction they will experience in the Hereafter as a result of their good deeds in this world.",لهم ما يشاءون عند ربهم ذلك جزاء المحسنين
4092,39,35,That Allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their reward for the best of what they used to do.,"This verse indicates that Allah will forgive the believers for their worst sins and misdeeds, and reward them for the best of their deeds and actions.

4093,39,36,Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they threaten you with those besides Him. And whoever Allah leaves astray - for him there is no guide.,"Allah is questioning whether He is not sufficient to protect and aid His servant (the Prophet Muhammad). The disbelievers are threatening the Prophet with their false deities besides Allah, but these deities have no power to harm or benefit anyone. Whoever Allah allows to deviate from the right path will have no guide to lead them to the truth.",أليس الله بكاف عبده ويخوفونك بالذين من دونه ومن يضلل الله فما له من هاد
4094,39,37,"And whoever Allah guides - there is none to misguide him. Is not Allah Exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution?","This verse emphasizes Allah's absolute sovereignty and power. It states that whoever Allah guides to the right path, there is no one who can lead them astray or misguide them. This highlights Allah's perfect guidance and that true guidance comes only from Him. The verse then rhetorically asks: ""Is not Allah Exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution?"" This affirms Allah's might, glory, and ability to punish those who defy Him and reject His guidance. The verse serves as a reminder of Allah's authority and a warning against straying from His path.",ومن يهد الله فما له من مضل أليس الله بعزيز ذي انتقام
4095,39,38,"And if you asked them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they would surely say, 'Allah.' Say, 'Have you considered what you invoke besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, could they remove His harm? Or if He intended me mercy, could they withhold His mercy?' Say, 'Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him the trusting put their trust.'","This verse emphasizes the Oneness of Allah as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It challenges the idolaters to ponder upon their false deities and realize their utter inability to either cause harm or bestow mercy. The verse affirms that Allah alone has the power to decree harm or mercy, and no one else can alter His decree. It concludes by declaring that putting one's trust solely in Allah is the essence of faith and the key to contentment.",ولئن سألتهم من خلق السماوات والأرض ليقولن الله قل أفرأيتم ما تدعون من دون الله إن أرادني الله بضر هل هن كاشفات ضره أو أرادني برحمة هل هن ممسكات رحمته قل حسبي الله عليه يتوكل المتوكلون
4096,39,39,"Say: O my people! Work according to your position; I too am working, and soon you will know","This verse encourages the Prophet and his followers to persevere in their efforts to spread the message of Islam, despite facing opposition and rejection from the disbelievers. It suggests that they should continue working according to their capabilities and remain steadfast in their beliefs and actions, while the disbelievers should also continue with their ways. Eventually, the truth will become evident, and they will realize the consequences of their choices.",قل يا قوم اعملوا على مكانتكم إني عامل فسوف تعلمون
4097,39,40,"Whoever receives a punishment that will disgrace him, and upon whom an enduring punishment will settle","This verse refers to the punishment and humiliation that awaits those who reject faith and disobey Allah's commands. The ""disgraceful punishment"" could refer to the shame and regret they will feel on the Day of Judgment, while the ""enduring punishment"" implies the eternal torment of Hellfire that will befall them.",من يأتيه عذاب يخزيه ويحل عليه عذاب مقيم
4098,39,41,"Verily, We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur'an) for mankind in truth. So, whosoever accepts the guidance, it is only for his own self; and whosoever goes astray, he goes astray only for his (own) loss. And you (O Muhammad) are not a dictator over them.","This verse emphasizes that the Qur'an has been revealed as a guidance for all of humanity, but it is up to each individual to choose whether to accept and follow it or reject it. Those who accept it will benefit themselves, while those who reject it will only harm themselves. The Prophet Muhammad is not a dictator forcing people to believe; rather, he is a messenger conveying the truth, and people have the free will to make their own choices regarding faith.",إنا أنزلنا عليك الكتاب للناس بالحق فمن اهتدى فلنفسه ومن ضل فإنما يضل عليها وما أنت عليهم بوكيل
4099,39,42,"It is Allah who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps the ones for which He has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.","This verse describes Allah's complete control over life and death. He takes the souls of those who die, and He also takes the souls of the living during sleep, which is a minor form of death. Upon waking up, He returns the souls. For those whose death He has decreed, He keeps their souls, but for others, He returns their souls until an appointed time. This demonstrates Allah's power and wisdom, which are signs for those who reflect.",الله يتوفى الأنفس حين موتها والتي لم تمت في منامها فيمسك التي قضى عليها الموت ويرسل الأخرى إلى أجل مسمى إن في ذلك لآيات لقوم يتفكرون

Say, ""Even though they do not possess anything, nor do they reason?""","This verse is rejecting the pagan belief of taking intercessors besides Allah.

It also emphasizes that Allah is the Sovereign and Absolute Ruler over the heavens and the earth, and that all creatures will ultimately return to Him for judgment and accountability.",قل لله الشفاعة جميعا له ملك السماوات والأرض ثم إليه ترجعون
4102,39,45,"And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter are filled with disgust. But when those besides Him are mentioned, they rejoice.","This verse highlights the contrasting reactions of the disbelievers when Allah is mentioned alone versus when false deities are mentioned. Their hearts are filled with aversion and disgust when Allah, the One True God, is mentioned because they reject the belief in the Hereafter. However, they rejoice and feel delighted when false gods or idols are mentioned, as they have misplaced their faith and allegiance.",وإذا ذكر الله وحده اشمأزت قلوب الذين لا يؤمنون بالآخرة وإذا ذكر الذين من دونه إذا هم يستبشرون
4103,39,46,"Say, 'O Allah, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You will judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ.'","This verse highlights Allah's sovereignty as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, and His perfect knowledge of all things, seen and unseen.

It states that even if the wrongdoers possessed all the riches of the earth and an equal amount with it, they would gladly offer it all as a ransom to save themselves from the severe torment. However, their ransom will not be accepted, and they will face the consequences of their actions, which they had never anticipated or accounted for from Allah.""",ولو أن للذين ظلموا ما في الأرض جميعا ومثله معه لافتدوا به من سوء العذاب يوم القيامة وبدا لهم من الله ما لم يكونوا يحتسبون
4105,39,48,"And the evil results of their deeds became manifest to them, and they were surrounded by that which they used to mock.","This verse warns of the consequences of rejecting faith and mocking the truth. When the disbelievers witnessed the punishment for their sins, the evil consequences of their misdeeds became clear to them. They were enveloped by the very thing they used to mock and make fun of, which was the divine punishment and the warnings of the messengers.",وبدا لهم سيئات ما كسبوا وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزئون
4106,39,49,"But when adversity touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We bestow on him a favor from Us, he says, ""I have only been given it because of [my] knowledge."" Rather, it is a trial, but most of them do not know.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and arrogance of humans. When afflicted with hardship, they turn to Allah and implore Him for relief. However, when Allah bestows His favors upon them, they become arrogant and attribute these blessings to their own knowledge and efforts, rather than acknowledging Allah's grace. This is a trial from Allah to test people's faith and gratitude, yet most people fail to recognize it as such due to their ignorance.",فإذا مس الإنسان ضر دعانا ثم إذا خولناه نعمة منا قال إنما أوتيته على علم بل هي فتنة ولكن أكثرهم لا يعلمون

The verse emphasizes that no one can escape the consequences of their actions or ""cause failure"" to God's justice.",فأصابهم سيئات ما كسبوا والذين ظلموا من هؤلاء سيصيبهم سيئات ما كسبوا وما هم بمعجزين
4109,39,52,Do they not know that it is Allah who extends provision for whom He wills and restricts it? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.,"This verse emphasizes Allah's complete control over sustenance and provision. He grants abundance to whomever He wills, and restricts it from whomever He wills, according to His infinite wisdom.

4114,39,57,"Or you say, 'If only Allah had guided me, I would have been among the righteous.'","This verse addresses those who reject faith and guidance, making excuses for their disbelief. It suggests that they claim that if Allah had guided them, they would have been among the righteous and God-fearing people. However, this is merely an excuse, as Allah has provided clear guidance through His revelations and messengers. The responsibility lies with individuals to accept or reject the guidance offered to them.",أو تقول لو أن الله هداني لكنت من المتقين

It emphasizes that He is in complete control over all affairs and nothing happens without His knowledge and permission. The Arabic word ""Wakil"" implies that Allah is the ultimate Trustee, Disposer of affairs, and Guardian over His creation. This instills a sense of complete reliance and trust in Allah's wisdom and plans.",الله خالق كل شيء وهو على كل شيء وكيل

The ""keys"" symbolize authority and dominion. By stating that the keys of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah, it means that He alone has the power to control and regulate all affairs in the heavens and on earth. The verse then warns those who reject Allah's signs and revelations that they are the real losers, for they have turned away from the path of truth and guidance.",له مقاليد السماوات والأرض والذين كفروا بآيات الله أولئك هم الخاسرون

4237,41,20,"Until, when they come to it, their hearing, their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.","This verse indicates that on the Day of Judgment, the human faculties of hearing, sight, and even the skin will bear witness against the disbelievers regarding their misdeeds and rejection of faith. It emphasizes that every part of the human being will testify to the truth, leaving no room for denial or concealment of one's actions in this world. The verse serves as a warning that all our deeds are being recorded, and we will be held accountable for them on the final Day.",حتى إذا ما جاءوها شهد عليهم سمعهم وأبصارهم وجلودهم بما كانوا يعملون
4238,41,21,"And they will say to their skins, 'Why did you testify against us?'

It has ruined you, and you became among the losers.",This verse criticizes those who make false assumptions about Allah and His attributes. It warns that such baseless assumptions will lead to spiritual ruin and being among the losers on the Day of Judgment. The interpretation emphasizes the grave consequences of having incorrect beliefs about Allah based on mere conjecture and supposition.,وذلكم ظنكم الذي ظننتم بربكم أرداكم فأصبحتم من الخاسرين
4241,41,24,"But if they endure patiently, the Fire will be a home for them, and if they seek to appease, they are not of those who will be excused.","This verse warns those who reject faith and persist in disbelief that if they remain patient upon their ways, then the Hellfire will be their ultimate abode and dwelling place. However, if they seek to make amends or repentance, it will not be accepted from them, for they are not among those whose repentance is accepted due to their stubborn rejection of faith.",فإن يصبروا فالنار مثوى لهم وإن يستعتبوا فما هم من المعتبين
4242,41,25,"And We have appointed for them companions who made alluring to them what was before them and what was behind them, and the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon them among nations that had previously passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.",هذه الآية تشير إلى أن الله قيض للكفار قرناء من الشياطين يزينون لهم أعمالهم الباطلة، ويحسنون لهم ما قدموا وما أخروا من الأعمال الشريرة. وقد حق عليهم القول بالعذاب كما حق على الأمم السابقة من الجن والإنس الذين كانوا على ضلال مثلهم. فهم خاسرون في الدنيا والآخرة بسبب كفرهم وإتباعهم للشياطين.,وقيضنا لهم قرناء فزينوا لهم ما بين أيديهم وما خلفهم وحق عليهم القول في أمم قد خلت من قبلهم من الجن والإنس إنهم كانوا خاسرين
4243,41,26,"And those who disbelieved say, 'Do not listen to this Qur'an and make noise during its recitation so that you may overcome.'","The disbelievers are instructing others not to listen attentively to the Qur'an, but rather to make noise and distractions during its recitation. Their aim is to prevent people from being influenced by the divine message, as they fear it may cause them to abandon their false beliefs and ""overcome"" their disbelief.",وقال الذين كفروا لا تسمعوا لهذا القرآن والغوا فيه لعلكم تغلبون
4244,41,27,"So We will surely make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they used to do.","This verse warns the disbelievers that they will face a severe punishment from Allah for rejecting faith and engaging in evil deeds. It emphasizes that Allah will recompense them fully for the worst of their actions, leaving no evil deed unpunished.

For them will be the home of eternity as recompense for what they used to deny Our verses.,"This verse describes the ultimate punishment for those who reject Allah's signs and deny His revelations. The ""recompense"" or ""reward"" for being enemies of Allah is the eternal Fire of Hell. They will abide there forever as a fitting recompense for their disbelief and rejection of Allah's clear signs and revelations.",ذلك جزاء أعداء الله النار لهم فيها دار الخلد جزاء بما كانوا بآياتنا يجحدون

4250,41,33,"And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteous deeds and says, 'Indeed, I am of the Muslims'?","This verse highlights the virtues of those who call others to the path of Allah through their speech and actions. The best speech is that which invites people to submit to Allah's will and follow His guidance, accompanied by righteous deeds that serve as a practical example. Such individuals declare their sincere belief in Islam, aligning their words with their deeds. This verse encourages Muslims to be ambassadors of the faith through their words and conduct.",ومن أحسن قولا ممن دعا إلى الله وعمل صالحا وقال إنني من المسلمين
4251,41,34,And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and between him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.,"This verse teaches us to respond to evil with good. When someone wrongs us, we should not retaliate with more evil, but rather respond with kindness and forgiveness. By doing so, we may transform enmity into friendship, as the verse states that the one who was an enemy will become ""as though he was a devoted friend.""",ولا تستوي الحسنة ولا السيئة ادفع بالتي هي أحسن فإذا الذي بينك وبينه عداوة كأنه ولي حميم

4254,41,37,"And among His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to Allah, who created them, if it should be Him that you worship.","This verse emphasizes the importance of worshipping Allah alone and not associating partners with Him. The night, day, sun, and moon are signs of Allah's power and greatness, but they are merely creations and should not be worshipped themselves. Instead, one should prostrate and submit to Allah, the Creator of all these signs and the One who deserves true worship and devotion.",ومن آياته الليل والنهار والشمس والقمر لا تسجدوا للشمس ولا للقمر واسجدوا لله الذي خلقهن إن كنتم إياه تعبدون

There are countless beings in the heavens and on earth that glorify Allah day and night, without ever becoming tired or bored of doing so. Their constant praise and worship of Allah is a manifestation of His greatness and majesty, and a reminder that His glory is not diminished by the disbelief of those who are too arrogant to submit to Him.",فإن استكبروا فالذين عند ربك يسبحون له بالليل والنهار وهم لا يسأمون
4256,41,39,"And among His Signs is that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water upon it, it thrills and swells. Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is Able to give life to the dead. Indeed, He is Able to do all things.","""This verse highlights Allah's power and ability to give life. The barren and lifeless earth is used as an example to show how Allah can revive it by sending down rain, causing it to become fertile and lush with vegetation. Just as He brings life to the dead earth, He has the power to resurrect the dead on the Day of Judgment. This verse affirms Allah's complete control and capability over all things.""",ومن آياته أنك ترى الأرض خاشعة فإذا أنزلنا عليها الماء اهتزت وربت إن الذي أحياها لمحيي الموتى إنه على كل شيء قدير

Do whatever you will; indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.","Allah warns those who deny or reject His revelations that they are not hidden from Him, and He will hold them accountable. The rhetorical question posed contrasts the miserable state of those cast into Hellfire with those who come securely on the Day of Resurrection due to their faith and righteous deeds. It emphasizes that one's ultimate outcome depends on one's choices and actions in this life, as Allah is fully Aware of what people do.",إن الذين يلحدون في آياتنا لا يخفون علينا أفمن يلقى في النار خير أم من يأتي آمنا يوم القيامة اعملوا ما شئتم إنه بما تعملون بصير

4260,41,43,"Nothing is said to you except what was said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty.","This verse reassures the Prophet Muhammad that the opposition and rejection he faces from his people is not unique, but a common experience shared by previous prophets. It highlights two key attributes of God: His forgiveness for those who repent and believe, and His severe punishment for those who persist in disbelief and disobedience. The verse serves as a reminder of God's mercy and justice, encouraging the Prophet to remain patient and steadfast in conveying the divine message.",ما يقال لك إلا ما قد قيل للرسل من قبلك إن ربك لذو مغفرة وذو عقاب أليم

Say, ""It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure. And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place.""","The interpretation is that the Qur'an being revealed in Arabic is a mercy from Allah, as it was meant for the Arabs who would have rejected it if it was in a foreign language. For the believers, it is a guidance and cure for their spiritual ailments. But for the disbelievers, it is as if they are deaf and blind to its message, unable to comprehend it, as they are being called from a distant place, i.e. far from the truth.",ولو جعلناه قرآنا أعجميا لقالوا لولا فصلت آياته أأعجمي وعربي قل هو للذين آمنوا هدى وشفاء والذين لا يؤمنون في آذانهم وقر وهو عليهم عمى أولئك ينادون من مكان بعيد

And indeed they are, concerning it, in disquieting doubt.","The interpretation is that Allah gave the Torah to Prophet Moses, but the people differed in their understanding and application of it. If it were not for Allah's prior decree to delay judgment until the Day of Resurrection, the matter would have been settled between them in this world. However, the disbelievers remain in disturbing doubt regarding the truth of the Torah.",ولقد آتينا موسى الكتاب فاختلف فيه ولولا كلمة سبقت من ربك لقضي بينهم وإنهم لفي شك منه مريب
4263,41,46,"Whoever does a good deed, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against it, and your Lord is not unjust to (His) servants.","This verse emphasizes individual responsibility and accountability. Each person is responsible for their own actions, whether good or bad. Good deeds benefit the doer, while evil actions harm the perpetrator. Allah is just and does not wrong anyone. The consequences of our actions are upon ourselves.",من عمل صالحا فلنفسه ومن أساء فعليها وما ربك بظلام للعبيد
4264,41,47,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. And fruits emerge not from their coverings, nor does a female conceive or deliver except with His knowledge.

Nothing happens in this universe without His knowledge and permission, not even the emergence of a fruit from its bud or the conception and delivery of a child. On the Day of Judgment, Allah will question the polytheists about the partners they associated with Him, and they will have no answer, admitting that none of their so-called partners can bear witness on their behalf.",إليه يرد علم الساعة وما تخرج من ثمرات من أكمامها وما تحمل من أنثى ولا تضع إلا بعلمه ويوم يناديهم أين شركائي قالوا آذناك ما منا من شهيد

4266,41,49,"Man does not get tired of supplicating for good, but when evil afflicts him, he becomes hopeless and despairing.","This verse highlights the nature of human beings. They persistently ask for good things from Allah, but when faced with difficulties or hardships, they quickly lose hope and become despondent. It reminds us to have patience and trust in Allah during trying times, and not to give in to despair.",لا يسأم الإنسان من دعاء الخير وإن مسه الشر فيئوس قنوط
4267,41,50,"And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, ""This is due to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur. And if I am returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best."" But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment.","This verse refers to the arrogance and ingratitude of disbelievers. If Allah bestows His mercy upon them after facing difficulties, they become arrogant and attribute this blessing to their own efforts, denying the coming of the Day of Resurrection. However, Allah warns that He will inform them of their misdeeds and make them taste a severe punishment for their disbelief and arrogance.",ولئن أذقناه رحمة منا من بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن هذا لي وما أظن الساعة قائمة ولئن رجعت إلى ربي إن لي عنده للحسنى فلننبئن الذين كفروا بما عملوا ولنذيقنهم من عذاب غليظ
4268,41,51,"And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive supplication.","This verse highlights the ingratitude and forgetfulness of human beings.

However, when adversity strikes or they face hardship, they immediately turn to earnest supplication and prayer, seeking Allah's help and mercy.",وإذا أنعمنا على الإنسان أعرض ونأى بجانبه وإذا مسه الشر فذو دعاء عريض
4269,41,52,"Say, 'Have you considered: if the Qur'an was from Allah and you disbelieved in it, who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension?'","This verse emphasizes the grave consequences of rejecting the Qur'an if it is truly from Allah. It poses a rhetorical question, asking who could be more misguided than those who defy Allah's revelation while being fully aware of its divine origin. The verse warns against stubbornly persisting in disbelief and dissension, which leads to the utmost misguidance and distance from the truth.",قل أرأيتم إن كان من عند الله ثم كفرتم به من أضل ممن هو في شقاق بعيد
4270,41,53,"We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth.

These signs will become apparent to those who reflect, until the truth becomes evident to them.

It emphasizes the unity of the source, Allah the Almighty and All-Wise, and the universality of the message, despite being revealed at different times and places. The description of Allah as ""al-'Azeez"" (the Exalted in Might) and ""al-Hakeem"" (the Wise) highlights His power and wisdom in choosing His messengers and revealing His guidance.",كذلك يوحي إليك وإلى الذين من قبلك الله العزيز الحكيم

The verse also instills a sense of hope and purpose, reminding us that our journey does not end with death, but rather continues in the Hereafter.",وإنا إلى ربنا لمنقلبون
4339,43,15,"Yet they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Truly, man is clearly ungrateful.","This verse criticizes the polytheistic belief of associating partners with Allah in worship. It condemns the practice of assigning a portion of Allah's divinity to created beings, whether humans, angels, or idols. Such an act is a manifestation of ingratitude towards Allah, the sole Creator and Sustainer of all existence. The verse emphasizes that humans are evidently ungrateful when they engage in such polytheistic beliefs and practices.",وجعلوا له من عباده جزءا إن الإنسان لكفور مبين
4340,43,16,"Or has He taken, from what He creates, daughters, and chosen you with sons?","This verse questions the polytheists' belief of attributing daughters to Allah while preferring sons for themselves. It criticizes their illogical stance of ascribing to Allah what they themselves dislike, which contradicts the perfect attributes of Allah who is far above such inconsistencies.",أم اتخذ مما يخلق بنات وأصفاكم بالبنين
4341,43,17,"And when one of them is given good tidings of [the birth of] a female, his face remains darkened, and he suppresses grief.","This verse criticizes the ignorant attitude of those who feel ashamed or distressed upon the birth of a daughter, considering it a disgrace. It condemns the practice of attributing imperfect qualities to Allah, the Most Merciful, by expressing displeasure at the creation He has brought into existence.",وإذا بشر أحدهم بما ضرب للرحمن مثلا ظل وجهه مسودا وهو كظيم
4342,43,18,"Or who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? Is there any deity with Allah? Say, ""Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.""",This verse questions the belief in deities other than Allah. It argues that only Allah has the power to create and sustain all of creation. The verse challenges the idolaters to provide evidence for their beliefs if they are truthful in their claims of other gods besides Allah.,أومن ينشأ في الحلية وهو في الخصام غير مبين
4343,43,19,"And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.","This verse criticizes the pagan Arabs for their belief that angels, who are God's obedient servants, are females. It questions their logic by asking if they witnessed the creation of angels to make such a claim. It warns that their false testimony will be recorded, and they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Judgment.",وجعلوا الملائكة الذين هم عباد الرحمن إناثا أشهدوا خلقهم ستكتب شهادتهم ويسألون
4344,43,20,"And they say, 'If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them.' They have no knowledge of that. They are only conjecturing.","The disbelievers claim that if Allah had willed, they would not have worshipped idols or false deities. However, their claim is baseless, as they have no knowledge or evidence to support it. They are merely making conjectures and guesses without any solid proof or divine guidance.",وقالوا لو شاء الرحمن ما عبدناهم ما لهم بذلك من علم إن هم إلا يخرصون
4345,43,21,Or have We given them a Book before this to which they are holding fast?,This verse questions whether the disbelievers were given a scripture from God before the Qur'an that justifies their rejection of the message brought by Prophet Muhammad. It implies that their denial has no valid basis and is merely a stubborn refusal to accept the truth.,أم آتيناهم كتابا من قبله فهم به مستمسكون
4346,43,22,"But they say: 'We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.'","This verse criticizes the blind following of ancestral traditions and customs without questioning or reasoning. It suggests that people often justify their beliefs and practices by claiming that their forefathers followed the same path, considering it a valid reason to continue those ways without reflecting on their validity or truth. The verse implies that such an attitude is misguided, as one should seek guidance through reason and contemplation rather than blindly adhering to inherited practices.",بل قالوا إنا وجدنا آباءنا على أمة وإنا على آثارهم مهتدون
4347,43,23,"And thus We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its wealthy ones said, 'Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following.'","This verse highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of the wealthy and privileged class in rejecting the message of God's messengers. They cling to the traditions and beliefs of their forefathers, refusing to accept the truth brought by the prophets. Their attachment to the status quo and their unwillingness to change stems from their desire to preserve their wealth, power, and social standing. The verse serves as a reminder that blind adherence to inherited customs and rejection of divine guidance have been recurring patterns throughout history.",وكذلك ما أرسلنا من قبلك في قرية من نذير إلا قال مترفوها إنا وجدنا آباءنا على أمة وإنا على آثارهم مقتدون
4348,43,24,"Those who are endowed with knowledge say: 'If you were to bring them better guidance than what they found their forefathers following, they would still say: We reject the message you were sent with.'","This verse refers to the obstinacy and stubbornness of those who blindly follow the traditions of their forefathers, rejecting any new guidance or truth that contradicts their inherited beliefs, even if it is better and more enlightened. It highlights the difficulty of changing deeply-rooted cultural and religious norms, as people often cling to their inherited ways out of arrogance, ignorance, or fear of change.",قال أولو جئتكم بأهدى مما وجدتم عليه آباءكم قالوا إنا بما أرسلتم به كافرون
4349,43,25,So We took vengeance upon them; then see what was the end of the deniers.,"This verse warns of the severe consequences that befall those who reject the truth and deny God's revelations. It implies that just as previous nations were punished for their disbelief and disobedience, those who deny the message of the Qur'an will also face a similar fate. The phrase ""then see what was the end of the deniers"" serves as a reminder to reflect on the ultimate outcome of those who persistently reject faith, which is often destruction and ruin.",فانتقمنا منهم فانظر كيف كان عاقبة المكذبين
4350,43,26,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his father and his people, 'Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship'","Ibrahim (peace be upon him) declared his dissociation and freedom from the idolatrous beliefs and practices of his people. He rejected their worship of idols and false deities, establishing his firm belief in the Oneness of Allah.",وإذ قال إبراهيم لأبيه وقومه إنني براء مما تعبدون
4351,43,27,"Except for the One Who created me; and indeed, He will guide me.","This verse indicates that true guidance comes only from Allah, the Creator. The speaker acknowledges that Allah alone has the power to guide him to the right path, and he places his trust in Allah to provide him with guidance and direction in life.",إلا الذي فطرني فإنه سيهدين
4352,43,28,And He made it a Word to endure among his offspring that they might return [to Allah].,"Allah made the phrase ""There is no deity but Allah"" a lasting legacy among the descendants of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) so that they may return to the worship of the One True God and abandon polytheism and idol worship.",وجعلها كلمة باقية في عقبه لعلهم يرجعون
4353,43,29,But We granted enjoyments to these and their forefathers until the truth came to them and a clear Messenger.,"The verse is indicating that Allah granted worldly pleasures and enjoyments to the disbelievers and their ancestors for a period of time, allowing them to indulge in their desires. However, this continued until the truth, in the form of the clear message of Islam brought by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, came to them. This suggests that their period of indulgence and heedlessness was temporary, and when the truth was revealed, they were held accountable for their actions.",بل متعت هؤلاء وآباءهم حتى جاءهم الحق ورسول مبين
4354,43,30,"And when the truth came to them, they said, 'This is magic, and indeed we are disbelievers in it.'","This verse refers to the disbelievers' rejection of the truth brought by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. They dismissed the Qur'an and the message of Islam as mere ""magic"" and declared their disbelief in it. This shows their stubbornness and unwillingness to accept the truth, even when it was presented to them clearly. They chose to remain in denial and cling to their false beliefs and practices.",ولما جاءهم الحق قالوا هذا سحر وإنا به كافرون
4355,43,31,"And they say, 'Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?'","The disbelievers questioned why the Qur'an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad, who was not a man of high social standing or wealth, rather than to a prominent man from Mecca or Ta'if, the two major cities in the region. This shows their arrogance and rejection of the truth based on worldly standards rather than judging the message itself.",وقالوا لولا نزل هذا القرآن على رجل من القريتين عظيم
4356,43,32,"Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so that some may employ others in their work. But the Mercy from your Lord is better than the wealth which they amass.",هذا استفهام إنكاري، يُنكر على الكفار الذين يتصرفون كأنهم هم الذين يقسمون رحمة الله على عباده. فالله هو الذي يتفضل برحمته على من يشاء من عباده، ويقسم أرزاقهم في الدنيا حسب حكمته وتقديره، فرفع بعضهم على بعض في المنازل والأرزاق، ليتعاونوا ويستعين بعضهم بعضًا في المعاش. ولكن رحمة الله في الآخرة خير مما يجمعه الناس من متاع الدنيا الفاني.,أهم يقسمون رحمت ربك نحن قسمنا بينهم معيشتهم في الحياة الدنيا ورفعنا بعضهم فوق بعض درجات ليتخذ بعضهم بعضا سخريا ورحمت ربك خير مما يجمعون
4357,43,33,"And if it were not that the people would become one community, We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful - for their houses ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount","Allah is saying that if He had not willed for people to remain as diverse nations and communities, with some believing and others disbelieving, He could have easily bestowed immense wealth and luxuries upon the disbelievers. However, this would remove the purpose of the test of faith and make everyone follow the same path without any choice or struggle. The diversity of beliefs and circumstances is a test and a means to distinguish the true believers from the disbelievers.",ولولا أن يكون الناس أمة واحدة لجعلنا لمن يكفر بالرحمن لبيوتهم سقفا من فضة ومعارج عليها يظهرون
4358,43,34,"And for their homes, they had doors and couches upon which they used to recline.","This verse refers to the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the people of 'Ad, a powerful ancient Arab tribe. It suggests that their homes had doors, which was a sign of wealth and security, and they had couches or elevated platforms on which they would lean or recline comfortably. This portrays their affluence and indulgence in material comforts before their eventual destruction as a punishment for their arrogance and disbelief.",ولبيوتهم أبوابا وسررا عليها يتكئون
4359,43,35,And ornaments of gold. But all this is only a passing enjoyment of the present life. The Hereafter with your Lord is for the God-fearing.,"The verse is reminding believers that worldly adornments and luxuries are temporary and fleeting. True and lasting bliss lies in the Hereafter, which is reserved for those who fear and obey Allah. It encourages focusing on the eternal rather than being consumed by transient worldly pleasures.",وزخرفا وإن كل ذلك لما متاع الحياة الدنيا والآخرة عند ربك للمتقين
4360,43,36,"And whoever is blind to the remembrance of the Most Merciful - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.","This verse is a warning for those who turn away from remembering Allah and following His guidance. For such people, Allah assigns a devil (shaytan) who becomes their constant companion, leading them further astray and misguiding them from the straight path. The devil's role is to make evil appear appealing and to prevent the person from seeing the truth, keeping them in spiritual blindness and away from Allah's mercy and guidance.",ومن يعش عن ذكر الرحمن نقيض له شيطانا فهو له قرين
4361,43,37,"And indeed they do turn them away from the path, but they think that they are rightly guided.","This verse refers to the disbelievers who mislead people away from the straight path of Islam by their words and actions. They think they are on the right guidance, but in reality, they are the ones who are misguided.",وإنهم ليصدونهم عن السبيل ويحسبون أنهم مهتدون
4362,43,38,"Until, when he came to Us [at the time of death], he said, 'Oh, I wish there was between me and you the distance between the two easts, for you were the worst of companions.'","This verse refers to the regret and sorrow that the disbelievers will feel on the Day of Judgment when they realize the consequences of their rejection of faith and their companionship with Satan. The disbeliever will wish for the greatest possible distance between himself and Satan, whom he had taken as a close companion in the worldly life, as he now recognizes Satan as the 'worst of companions' who misguided him towards eternal punishment.",حتى إذا جاءنا قال يا ليت بيني وبينك بعد المشرقين فبئس القرين
4363,43,39,And never will it benefit you that Day - when you have wronged - that you are partners in punishment.,"""This verse indicates that on the Day of Judgment, no partnership or relationship will benefit those who committed wrongdoings and injustices. They will all share in the punishment, regardless of their worldly ties or associations. It serves as a warning against oppression and injustice, as no one will be spared from the consequences of their misdeeds on that Day.""",ولن ينفعكم اليوم إذ ظلمتم أنكم في العذاب مشتركون
4364,43,40,"So, would you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and he who is in manifest error?","This verse questions the ability of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to make those who are spiritually deaf and blind hear and see the truth. It implies that only Allah has the power to guide those who are lost in misguidance and error to the right path. The Prophet's role is to convey the message, but guidance ultimately comes from Allah.",أفأنت تسمع الصم أو تهدي العمي ومن كان في ضلال مبين
4365,43,41,"So either We will take you away [for death], and then indeed, We will take retribution upon them.",إن لم نستجب لك يا محمد في دعوتك لهؤلاء القوم المشركين، فسوف نتوفاك ونميتك قبل أن ننتقم منهم بالعذاب والهلاك، لأنهم كذبوك وآذوك وآذوا المؤمنين معك.,فإما نذهبن بك فإنا منهم منتقمون
4366,43,42,"Or We show you that which We have promised them, for indeed We are perfect Disposers over them.","This verse suggests that Allah has complete power and authority over all beings and events. He can either fulfill the promised punishment for the disbelievers whenever He wills, or delay it according to His wisdom. The interpretation emphasizes Allah's absolute control and ability to carry out whatever He decrees.",أو نرينك الذي وعدناهم فإنا عليهم مقتدرون
4367,43,43,"So hold firmly to what has been revealed to you. Surely, you are on a straight path.","This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to adhere firmly to the divine revelation, the Qur'an, which was sent down to him from Allah. It affirms that he is on the right and straight path, guided by the truth from his Lord. The interpretation emphasizes the importance of following the guidance of the Qur'an steadfastly, as it leads to the straight path and the pleasure of Allah.",فاستمسك بالذي أوحي إليك إنك على صراط مستقيم
4368,43,44,"And indeed, it is a reminder for you and your people, and you are going to be questioned.",This verse suggests that the Qur'an is a reminder and guidance for the Prophet Muhammad and his people. It also implies that they will be held accountable and questioned about how they responded to this divine message on the Day of Judgment.,وإنه لذكر لك ولقومك وسوف تسألون
4369,43,45,And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers - did We appoint besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?,"This verse emphasizes the fundamental message of monotheism (Tawheed) that was brought by all the Prophets of Allah. It instructs the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to inquire from the previous messengers if they ever taught their people to worship any deity besides the One True God, the Most Merciful. The rhetorical question highlights that the core principle advocated by all Prophets was the worship of Allah alone, rejecting the association of any partners with Him.",واسأل من أرسلنا من قبلك من رسلنا أجعلنا من دون الرحمن آلهة يعبدون
4370,43,46,"And We did send Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, and he said: 'I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.'","This verse refers to the mission of Prophet Moses when he was sent by Allah to Pharaoh and his people with clear signs and miracles. Moses declared that he is the Messenger of the Lord of all the Worlds, conveying the message of Tawheed (Oneness of God) and calling them to worship Allah alone and abandon their false deities and oppressive ways.",ولقد أرسلنا موسى بآياتنا إلى فرعون وملئه فقال إني رسول رب العالمين
4371,43,47,"But when Our clear signs came to them, they ridiculed them.","This verse is criticizing the disbelievers who mocked and ridiculed the clear signs and revelations from Allah. It highlights their arrogance and rejection of the truth, as they found amusement in the divine messages instead of reflecting upon them with sincerity and humility.",فلما جاءهم بآياتنا إذا هم منها يضحكون
4372,43,48,"And We do not show them a sign except that it is greater than its sister, and We seize them with punishment so that they may return.","Allah is saying that He sends clear signs and miracles to the disbelievers, each one greater and more convincing than the previous one. However, when they persist in denying the truth, He seizes them with punishment and afflictions in the hope that they may abandon their disbelief and return to faith in the Oneness of Allah.",وما نريهم من آية إلا هي أكبر من أختها وأخذناهم بالعذاب لعلهم يرجعون
4373,43,49,"And they said: 'O you sorcerer! Invoke for us your Lord according to what He has covenanted with you. Indeed, we will surely follow guidance.'","This verse refers to the arrogant and obstinate attitude of Pharaoh and his people towards Prophet Moses. Despite witnessing clear signs and miracles, they mockingly called him a ""sorcerer"" and challenged him to invoke his Lord to fulfill the covenant or promise made to him. Their claim of being guided was insincere and derisive.",وقالوا يا أيه الساحر ادع لنا ربك بما عهد عندك إننا لمهتدون
4374,43,50,"But when We removed the punishment from them, at once they broke their word.","The interpretation is that when Allah removed the punishment and hardship from the disbelieving people, instead of being grateful and fulfilling their promises to Allah, they went back on their word and continued in their disbelief and disobedience. This verse highlights the ungrateful and treacherous nature of the disbelievers.",فلما كشفنا عنهم العذاب إذا هم ينكثون
4375,43,51,"And Pharaoh called out among his people. He said, ""O my people, do I not possess the kingdom of Egypt, and these rivers flowing beneath me? Then do you not see?""","""Pharaoh arrogantly boasted about his possession of Egypt and the Nile river, which was the source of life and prosperity for the Egyptians. He used this as a way to assert his power and authority over his people, implying that they should be grateful to him and obedient, since he controlled the resources that sustained them. This verse highlights Pharaoh's egotistical and tyrannical nature, as he tried to portray himself as a god-like figure deserving of worship and obedience.""",ونادى فرعون في قومه قال يا قوم أليس لي ملك مصر وهذه الأنهار تجري من تحتي أفلا تبصرون
4376,43,52,Or am I better than this one who is insignificant and scarcely expresses himself?,"This verse is a rhetorical question posed by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in response to the mockery and disbelief of the Quraysh tribe. It suggests that the Prophet, as the recipient of divine revelation and guidance, is far superior to those who belittle him and struggle to articulate their thoughts coherently. The verse highlights the contrast between the Prophet's noble character and the pettiness of his detractors.",أم أنا خير من هذا الذي هو مهين ولا يكاد يبين
4377,43,53,"Why were not bracelets of gold bestowed on him, or angels sent along with him?","This verse is questioning the disbelievers' rejection of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a messenger of God. They demanded tangible signs like bracelets of gold or angels accompanying him as proof of his prophethood. However, the verse implies that such demands are unreasonable, as the true sign of prophethood is the divine message itself, not worldly adornments or supernatural phenomena.",فلولا ألقي عليه أسورة من ذهب أو جاء معه الملائكة مقترنين
4378,43,54,"But he persuaded his people, and they obeyed him. Truly, they were defiantly disobedient people.","This verse suggests that the person being referred to was able to convince his people to follow him, even though they were rebellious and disobedient towards God.

Rather, they are a people prone to obstinacy.","The interpretation is that the disbelievers are questioning whether their idols are better or Allah, but they do not pose this question sincerely seeking truth. Rather, they ask it out of stubbornness and argumentation, as they are a people inclined to dispute and resist the truth.",وقالوا أآلهتنا خير أم هو ما ضربوه لك إلا جدلا بل هم قوم خصمون

Those who have faith and perform righteous actions will be rewarded with Paradise, which is a truthful promise from Allah.",أولئك الذين نتقبل عنهم أحسن ما عملوا ونتجاوز عن سيئاتهم في أصحاب الجنة وعد الصدق الذي كانوا يوعدون
4526,46,17,"And he who says to his parents, ""Uff to you! Do you promise me that I will be brought forth [from the earth] when generations have already passed on before me?"" while they call to Allah for help [and to Him], ""Woe to you! Believe! Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth."" But he says, ""This is not but legends of the former peoples.""","This verse refers to the disbelievers who mocked the idea of resurrection and the life after death. They ridiculed their believing parents for having faith in Allah's promise of resurrection, considering it mere fables of ancient people. The interpretation highlights the arrogance and stubbornness of those who reject faith, even when their parents plead with them to believe in the truth of Allah's promise.",والذي قال لوالديه أف لكما أتعدانني أن أخرج وقد خلت القرون من قبلي وهما يستغيثان الله ويلك آمن إن وعد الله حق فيقول ما هذا إلا أساطير الأولين
4527,46,18,"Those are the ones against whom the word concerning nations that had passed away before them of jinn and humans has become due. Indeed, they were losers.","This verse refers to those who have rejected faith and followed disbelief. They are like the previous nations of jinn and humans who were destroyed for their rejection of Allah's messengers and signs. The ""word"" that became due upon them refers to Allah's punishment and torment in this world and the Hereafter for their persistent disbelief and disobedience. They are described as ""losers"" because they have lost the opportunity for salvation and eternal bliss by choosing the path of misguidance.",أولئك الذين حق عليهم القول في أمم قد خلت من قبلهم من الجن والإنس إنهم كانوا خاسرين
4528,46,19,"And for all there will be degrees [of reward and punishment] according to what they have done. And in order that He may fully compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.","This verse emphasizes the principle of justice and accountability in Islam. It states that every person will be rewarded or punished based on their deeds and actions in this world. The ""degrees"" mentioned refer to varying levels of reward or punishment proportionate to the good or bad deeds performed. Allah will fully recompense people for their actions, without any injustice or wrongdoing on His part. This verse highlights the importance of striving for righteous deeds and avoiding evil actions, as one's ultimate fate in the Hereafter depends on it.",ولكل درجات مما عملوا وليوفيهم أعمالهم وهم لا يظلمون
4529,46,20,"And on the Day when those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire [it will be said], 'You exhausted your pleasures during your worldly life and enjoyed them, so this Day you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you used to behave insolently.'","This verse warns the disbelievers about the punishment they will face on the Day of Judgment for indulging in worldly pleasures, being arrogant, and behaving rebelliously without any justification. They will be exposed to the Fire of Hell as a recompense for their arrogance, insolence, and rejection of faith during their worldly life. The verse emphasizes that their temporary enjoyment of pleasures in this life will be replaced by a humiliating and severe punishment in the Hereafter.",ويوم يعرض الذين كفروا على النار أذهبتم طيباتكم في حياتكم الدنيا واستمتعتم بها فاليوم تجزون عذاب الهون بما كنتم تستكبرون في الأرض بغير الحق وبما كنتم تفسقون
4530,46,21,"And mention, [O Muhammad], the brother of Thamud - when he warned his people at al-Ahqaf - and there had already passed warners before him and after him, [saying], 'Do not worship except Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day.'","This verse refers to the prophet Hud, who was sent to the tribe of Thamud to guide them to the worship of the One True God. He warned them of the severe punishment that would befall them if they continued in their idolatry and disobedience. Despite being preceded and succeeded by other prophets with the same message, the people of Thamud arrogantly rejected Hud's call to monotheism.",واذكر أخا عاد إذ أنذر قومه بالأحقاف وقد خلت النذر من بين يديه ومن خلفه ألا تعبدوا إلا الله إني أخاف عليكم عذاب يوم عظيم
4531,46,22,"They said, ""Have you come to delude us away from our gods? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.""","The disbelievers were mocking the Prophet and challenging him to bring upon them the punishment he warned them about if he was truthful in his message, as they were unwilling to abandon their false deities.",قالوا أجئتنا لتأفكنا عن آلهتنا فأتنا بما تعدنا إن كنت من الصادقين
4532,46,23,"He said: ""Verily, the knowledge is with Allah alone, and I convey to you what I have been sent with, but I see that you are an ignorant people.""","This verse suggests that true knowledge belongs to Allah alone, and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was merely conveying the message he was entrusted with. However, he observed that the people he was addressing were ignorant and lacked understanding, implying that they were rejecting or failing to comprehend the divine message.",قال إنما العلم عند الله وأبلغكم ما أرسلت به ولكني أراكم قوما تجهلون
4533,46,24,"But when they saw it as a cloud heading towards their valleys, they said, 'This is a cloud bringing us rain!' Rather, it is what you were seeking to hasten - a wind, wherein is a painful punishment.","The verse is referring to a punishment that was sent upon an ungrateful people who rejected the message of their prophet. When they saw a cloud approaching, they thought it would bring rain, but it was in fact a wind carrying a painful torment as a consequence for their disbelief and defiance of God's commands.",فلما رأوه عارضا مستقبل أوديتهم قالوا هذا عارض ممطرنا بل هو ما استعجلتم به ريح فيها عذاب أليم
4534,46,25,"It (the city) was utterly destroyed by the command of its Lord, so they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We recompense the people who were guilty of crimes.","This verse describes the complete destruction of a city as a punishment from Allah for the crimes of its people. It emphasizes that Allah's punishment is severe and leaves no trace except the empty dwellings. The verse serves as a warning against disobedience and wrongdoing, as Allah will hold accountable those who persist in sin and reject His guidance.",تدمر كل شيء بأمر ربها فأصبحوا لا يرى إلا مساكنهم كذلك نجزي القوم المجرمين
4535,46,26,"And We had certainly established them in such as We have not established you, and We made for them hearing and vision and hearts. But their hearing, vision and hearts availed them not from anything when they used to deny the signs of Allah, and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.","This verse refers to the disbelievers who were granted blessings and faculties like hearing, sight, and intellect, but they failed to utilize them properly by denying Allah's signs. Instead of being grateful, they mocked and ridiculed the truth, which ultimately led to their downfall and the consequences of their mockery enveloping them.",ولقد مكناهم فيما إن مكناكم فيه وجعلنا لهم سمعا وأبصارا وأفئدة فما أغنى عنهم سمعهم ولا أبصارهم ولا أفئدتهم من شيء إذ كانوا يجحدون بآيات الله وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزئون
4536,46,27,"And We have already destroyed what surrounds you of [those] cities, and We have diversified the signs that perhaps they might return [to righteousness].","This verse suggests that Allah has destroyed many nations and civilizations around the people being addressed, as a warning and a reminder for them to repent and return to the right path. The signs and lessons from the destruction of those communities were presented in various ways, so that they may take heed and reform themselves.",ولقد أهلكنا ما حولكم من القرى وصرفنا الآيات لعلهم يرجعون
4537,46,28,Then why did those whom they had taken for gods besides Allah as a way of approach [to Him] not help them? But they strayed from them. And that was their falsehood and what they were inventing.,"The interpretation is that Allah is questioning why the false deities that the polytheists worshipped did not help them, since they claimed that these deities brought them closer to Allah. It shows that these deities were powerless and could not benefit their worshippers at all. The polytheists had gone astray from the truth by inventing lies about these false gods.",فلولا نصرهم الذين اتخذوا من دون الله قربانا آلهة بل ضلوا عنهم وذلك إفكهم وما كانوا يفترون
4538,46,29,"And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, 'Listen quietly.' And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners.","This verse refers to an incident where a group of jinn (unseen beings) came across the Prophet Muhammad while he was reciting the Qur'an. They listened attentively and were captivated by its beauty and wisdom. After hearing it, they returned to their people to warn them of the truth and guidance contained in the Qur'an.",وإذ صرفنا إليك نفرا من الجن يستمعون القرآن فلما حضروه قالوا أنصتوا فلما قضي ولوا إلى قومهم منذرين

They recognized it as a divine revelation that confirms the previous scriptures, such as the Torah revealed to Moses, and guides humanity towards the truth and the straight path of righteousness and salvation.

It encourages people to respond positively to the call of faith, as doing so will lead to forgiveness of sins and salvation from a painful punishment in the Hereafter.

4541,46,32,"And whoever does not respond to Allah's caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there are no protectors for him besides Allah. Those are in manifest error.","This verse emphasizes the importance of heeding the call of Allah and following His guidance. Those who reject or turn away from Allah's caller, which refers to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the message of Islam, will find no refuge or protection from Allah's decree anywhere on earth. They have no helpers or supporters besides Allah, and they are clearly misguided and in manifest error by rejecting the truth.",ومن لا يجب داعي الله فليس بمعجز في الأرض وليس له من دونه أولياء أولئك في ضلال مبين

It affirms Allah's absolute power over all things.",أولم يروا أن الله الذي خلق السماوات والأرض ولم يعي بخلقهن بقادر على أن يحيي الموتى بلى إنه على كل شيء قدير
4543,46,34,"And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it will be said], 'Is this not the truth?' They will say, 'Yes, by our Lord,' He will say, 'Then taste the punishment for what you used to deny.'","This verse warns the disbelievers about the punishment they will face on the Day of Resurrection. When they are brought before the Hellfire, they will be asked if this is not the truth that they had denied in the worldly life. They will be forced to admit that it is indeed the truth from their Lord. As a result, they will be commanded to taste the punishment for their disbelief and rejection of the truth.",ويوم يعرض الذين كفروا على النار أليس هذا بالحق قالوا بلى وربنا قال فذوقوا العذاب بما كنتم تكفرون

This is a clear message: Shall any be destroyed except the transgressing people?","""This verse encourages the Prophet Muhammad to persevere with patience and steadfastness in the face of adversity, just as the resolute messengers before him did. It assures him that the punishment promised to the disbelievers will seem insignificant in duration, like just an hour of a day. The verse conveys that only the wicked and disobedient people will be destroyed, while the believers will be saved.""",فاصبر كما صبر أولو العزم من الرسل ولا تستعجل لهم كأنهم يوم يرون ما يوعدون لم يلبثوا إلا ساعة من نهار بلاغ فهل يهلك إلا القوم الفاسقون

It warns that Allah will render all of their deeds fruitless and worthless, as they have chosen disbelief and hindered others from guidance.",الذين كفروا وصدوا عن سبيل الله أضل أعمالهم
4546,47,2,And those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition.,"This verse promises forgiveness and spiritual reform for those who sincerely believe in Islam, do good deeds, and accept the revelation given to Prophet Muhammad as the truth from God. It emphasizes that true faith is accompanied by righteous actions and belief in the divine origin of the Qur'an. For such believers, God will pardon their past sins and improve their spiritual state.",والذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات وآمنوا بما نزل على محمد وهو الحق من ربهم كفر عنهم سيئاتهم وأصلح بالهم
4547,47,3,"That is because those who disbelieved followed falsehood, and those who believed followed the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah present to the people their comparisons.","This verse explains that the reason for the difference between the believers and disbelievers is that the disbelievers followed falsehood and rejected the truth, while the believers followed the truth revealed by Allah. Allah presents these examples and comparisons to people so that they may understand and be guided.",ذلك بأن الذين كفروا اتبعوا الباطل وأن الذين آمنوا اتبعوا الحق من ربهم كذلك يضرب الله للناس أمثالهم
4548,47,4,"So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens. That [is the command]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allah - never will He waste their deeds.","This verse provides instructions on how to deal with disbelievers in battle. It permits striking their necks (i.e., killing them) until they are subdued, then taking them as captives. After that, the Muslims have the choice to either free them as a favor or ransom them until the war ends. The verse also states that if Allah willed, He could have punished the disbelievers directly, but He ordained armed struggle to test the believers' faith and steadfastness. It concludes by reassuring that those who are martyred in Allah's cause will have their deeds accepted and rewarded.",فإذا لقيتم الذين كفروا فضرب الرقاب حتى إذا أثخنتموهم فشدوا الوثاق فإما منا بعد وإما فداء حتى تضع الحرب أوزارها ذلك ولو يشاء الله لانتصر منهم ولكن ليبلو بعضكم ببعض والذين قتلوا في سبيل الله فلن يضل أعمالهم

4551,47,7,"O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you and plant firmly your feet.","This verse encourages believers to support the cause of Allah by obeying His commands and striving for His religion.

It states that they will face misery and distress in this life and the Hereafter. Additionally, their deeds and actions, no matter how great they may seem, will be rendered worthless and futile since they were not performed with sincere faith and for the sake of Allah.",والذين كفروا فتعسا لهم وأضل أعمالهم
4553,47,9,"That is because they disliked what Allah revealed, so He rendered their deeds worthless.","This verse explains the reason behind the deeds of the disbelievers being rendered worthless and futile. It is because they harbored a deep dislike and aversion towards the revelation sent down by Allah, rejecting it out of arrogance and stubbornness. As a result, Allah nullified their deeds and they will receive no reward for them in the Hereafter.",ذلك بأنهم كرهوا ما أنزل الله فأحبط أعمالهم
4554,47,10,"Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed [everything] over them, and for the disbelievers is something similar.","This verse questions the disbelievers' failure to reflect on the fate of previous nations who denied the truth. It reminds them that Allah completely destroyed those nations for their disbelief, just as He will punish the present disbelievers in a similar manner if they persist in rejecting faith.",أفلم يسيروا في الأرض فينظروا كيف كان عاقبة الذين من قبلهم دمر الله عليهم وللكافرين أمثالها
4555,47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no protector.","This verse highlights the fundamental difference between believers and disbelievers in terms of their relationship with Allah. Believers have Allah as their Protector, Guardian, and Helper, who guides and supports them in this life and the Hereafter. On the other hand, disbelievers have no true protector or helper, as they have rejected the guidance of Allah and severed their connection with Him. This underscores the importance of faith and the dire consequences of disbelief.",ذلك بأن الله مولى الذين آمنوا وأن الكافرين لا مولى لهم
4556,47,12,"Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow, but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat, and the Fire will be a residence for them.","This verse draws a contrast between the ultimate fate of the believers and disbelievers. The believers who have faith and perform good deeds will be admitted to the eternal Gardens of Paradise, with rivers flowing beneath them, as a reward for their righteousness. On the other hand, the disbelievers who reject faith may indulge in worldly pleasures temporarily, consuming and enjoying like cattle, but their final abode will be the Fire of Hell as a punishment for their disbelief and evil actions.",إن الله يدخل الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات جنات تجري من تحتها الأنهار والذين كفروا يتمتعون ويأكلون كما تأكل الأنعام والنار مثوى لهم

We destroyed them, and there was no helper for them.","This verse refers to the disbelievers of Makkah who drove out the Prophet Muhammad and his companions from their hometown. Allah reminds them that He has destroyed many powerful nations in the past who were stronger than the Makkan disbelievers, and no one could help or save those nations from Allah's punishment when it came upon them for their disbelief and wrongdoing.",وكأين من قرية هي أشد قوة من قريتك التي أخرجتك أهلكناهم فلا ناصر لهم
4558,47,14,Is one who is on clear evidence from his Lord like one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive and they follow their desires?,"This verse contrasts the believer who follows clear guidance from Allah with the disbeliever who follows his desires. The believer has clear proof and evidence from his Lord, while the disbeliever is deceived by the attractive appearance of his evil deeds and follows his whims and desires instead of the truth.",أفمن كان على بينة من ربه كمن زين له سوء عمله واتبعوا أهواءهم
4559,47,15,"The example of the Paradise which the pious have been promised: in it are rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk with unchanging taste, and rivers of wine, a delight to the drinkers, and rivers of strained honey. And therein they shall have all kinds of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord. (Can this be compared to the state of) those who shall abide forever in the Fire and shall be given to drink boiling water that will cut up their entrails?","This verse contrasts the bountiful blessings of Paradise, described in vivid detail with its rivers of pure water, milk, wine and honey, and abundant fruits and forgiveness from God, with the torment of Hellfire where the disbelievers will abide forever and be given boiling water that will tear apart their insides. It highlights the stark difference between the eternal reward for the righteous and the eternal punishment for the disbelievers.",مثل الجنة التي وعد المتقون فيها أنهار من ماء غير آسن وأنهار من لبن لم يتغير طعمه وأنهار من خمر لذة للشاربين وأنهار من عسل مصفى ولهم فيها من كل الثمرات ومغفرة من ربهم كمن هو خالد في النار وسقوا ماء حميما فقطع أمعاءهم
4560,47,16,"And among them are those who listen to you, until when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge, 'What has he said just now?' Those are the ones of whom Allah has sealed over their hearts and they have followed their own desires.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who pretended to listen to the Prophet but did not sincerely accept his teachings. When they left his company, they mocked and ridiculed what he had said to those who had knowledge and understanding of the Qur'an. Allah has sealed their hearts, preventing them from accepting guidance, and they follow their own whims and desires rather than the truth.",ومنهم من يستمع إليك حتى إذا خرجوا من عندك قالوا للذين أوتوا العلم ماذا قال آنفا أولئك الذين طبع الله على قلوبهم واتبعوا أهواءهم
4561,47,17,"And those who were guided, He increased them in guidance and gave them their righteousness.","This verse refers to those who have accepted the guidance of Allah and followed the straight path. For such people, Allah increases their guidance, understanding, and insight into the religion. He also bestows upon them the quality of taqwa (righteousness, piety, and consciousness of Allah), which enables them to refrain from sins and engage in righteous deeds. This increase in guidance and taqwa is a reward and blessing from Allah for those who sincerely seek the truth and strive to follow it.",والذين اهتدوا زادهم هدى وآتاهم تقواهم

Then how will they have their reminder when it has come to them?,"This verse questions the disbelievers who deny the coming of the Hour (Day of Resurrection).

And Allah knows your movement and your resting place.,"This verse affirms the Oneness of Allah and instructs the believers to seek forgiveness from Him for their sins as well as to pray for forgiveness for all believing men and women. It also reminds us that Allah is All-Aware of our actions and movements, whether we are active or at rest.",فاعلم أنه لا إله إلا الله واستغفر لذنبك وللمؤمنين والمؤمنات والله يعلم متقلبكم ومثواكم

So woe to them!","This verse criticizes the hypocrites who questioned the revelation of the Qur'an and expressed doubt about its divine origin. When a decisive surah was revealed mentioning jihad and fighting against the disbelievers, those with sickness in their hearts - referring to the hypocrites - looked at the Prophet with fear and dread, as if they were about to faint from the prospect of fighting. The verse condemns their cowardice and lack of faith.",ويقول الذين آمنوا لولا نزلت سورة فإذا أنزلت سورة محكمة وذكر فيها القتال رأيت الذين في قلوبهم مرض ينظرون إليك نظر المغشي عليه من الموت فأولى لهم
4565,47,21,"Obedience and good words.

4566,47,22,"Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship?","This verse is warning against the potential abuse of power and authority. It questions whether, if given control, people would spread corruption on earth and sever family ties and relationships. The verse cautions against using power for destructive purposes that harm society and disrupt social cohesion.",فهل عسيتم إن توليتم أن تفسدوا في الأرض وتقطعوا أرحامكم
4567,47,23,"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed, so He deafened them and blinded their sight.","This verse refers to those who reject faith and turn away from the guidance of Allah. As a consequence, Allah has cursed them, rendering them spiritually deaf and blind. Their hearts are sealed, preventing them from perceiving the truth and being guided. This is a metaphorical expression of their state of disbelief and obstinacy towards the divine message.",أولئك الذين لعنهم الله فأصمهم وأعمى أبصارهم

Satan deceived them and made them have false hopes, leading them astray from the right path.",إن الذين ارتدوا على أدبارهم من بعد ما تبين لهم الهدى الشيطان سول لهم وأملى لهم
4570,47,26,"That is because they say to those who dislike what Allah has revealed, ""We will obey you in part of the matter,"" and Allah knows their secret conversation.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly professed Islam but inwardly harbored disbelief.

4571,47,27,"So how [will it be] when the angels take them in death, striking their faces and their backs?",This verse warns the disbelievers about the punishment they will face at the time of death. The angels will strike their faces and backs as a form of humiliation and punishment for rejecting the truth and following falsehood. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disbelief and emphasizes the importance of faith and righteous conduct.,فكيف إذا توفتهم الملائكة يضربون وجوههم وأدبارهم
4572,47,28,"That is because they followed what angered Allah and hated His pleasure, so He rendered their deeds worthless.","This verse explains the reason why the deeds of certain people were rendered worthless. It is because they followed what angered Allah by disobeying His commands, and they hated His pleasure by rejecting His guidance.

4574,47,30,"And if We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you would have known them by their marks. But you will surely know them by the tone of their speech. And Allah knows your deeds.","The interpretation is that Allah has the power to reveal the hypocrites to the Prophet, but He chose not to do so. Instead, the hypocrites would be recognized by their tone and manner of speech, which would betray their true intentions and lack of faith. Ultimately, Allah knows everyone's deeds, whether they are sincere believers or hypocrites.",ولو نشاء لأريناكهم فلعرفتهم بسيماهم ولتعرفنهم في لحن القول والله يعلم أعمالكم

4622,49,11,"O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame yourselves, nor insult one another with nicknames. Evil is the name of disobedience after faith. And whoever does not repent, then such are the wrongdoers.","This verse prohibits mocking, insulting or defaming others based on their race, ethnicity, gender or any other attribute. It teaches that no one is superior to others except by faith and righteousness. Ridiculing or degrading others is a grave sin after having accepted faith. Those who persist in such behavior without repentance are considered wrongdoers.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا يسخر قوم من قوم عسى أن يكونوا خيرا منهم ولا نساء من نساء عسى أن يكن خيرا منهن ولا تلمزوا أنفسكم ولا تنابزوا بالألقاب بئس الاسم الفسوق بعد الإيمان ومن لم يتب فأولئك هم الظالمون
4623,49,12,"O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion, indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.","This verse instructs the believers to avoid harboring excessive suspicion and mistrust towards others, as some forms of suspicion can lead to sin. It prohibits spying on others and backbiting, which involves speaking ill of someone behind their back. The verse uses a powerful analogy, asking if anyone would like to eat the flesh of their dead brother, which is something abhorrent and unacceptable. It then reminds the believers to fear Allah and have consciousness of Him, as He is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful towards those who repent.",يا أيها الذين آمنوا اجتنبوا كثيرا من الظن إن بعض الظن إثم ولا تجسسوا ولا يغتب بعضكم بعضا أيحب أحدكم أن يأكل لحم أخيه ميتا فكرهتموه واتقوا الله إن الله تواب رحيم

Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.","This verse emphasizes the fundamental equality and unity of all human beings, regardless of their racial, tribal, or ethnic backgrounds. It teaches that all people are created from the same origin - a single male and female - and that their division into nations and tribes is meant for the purpose of mutual recognition and understanding, not for boasting about one's superiority over others. The true criterion for honor and nobility in the sight of Allah is not one's lineage or worldly status, but rather one's consciousness of Allah (Taqwa) and adherence to His commandments. This verse promotes the values of equality, unity, and righteousness among all people.",يا أيها الناس إنا خلقناكم من ذكر وأنثى وجعلناكم شعوبا وقبائل لتعارفوا إن أكرمكم عند الله أتقاكم إن الله عليم خبير
4625,49,14,"The Bedouins say, 'We have believed.' Say, 'You have not [yet] believed; rather say, 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.'","This verse addresses the Bedouin Arabs who claimed to have embraced faith but had not truly internalized it. They are instructed to say they have submitted to Islam rather than claiming belief, since true faith requires sincere conviction in the heart. It reminds them that obedience to Allah and the Prophet is essential, and that their deeds will be rewarded if they have genuine faith and obedience. It highlights Allah's mercy and forgiveness for those who strive to follow His guidance.",قالت الأعراب آمنا قل لم تؤمنوا ولكن قولوا أسلمنا ولما يدخل الإيمان في قلوبكم وإن تطيعوا الله ورسوله لا يلتكم من أعمالكم شيئا إن الله غفور رحيم
4626,49,15,The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah. It is those who are the truthful.,"This verse defines the true believers as those who have complete faith in Allah and His Messenger, without any doubt, and are willing to sacrifice their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah.

And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything.""","This verse questions the arrogance of those who think they can dictate to Allah what religion He should accept from them. It emphasizes that Allah has perfect knowledge of everything in the heavens and the earth, and is fully aware of all things. Therefore, it is foolish for humans to attempt to impose their views on Allah, as He is the All-Knowing and All-Aware.",قل أتعلمون الله بدينكم والله يعلم ما في السماوات وما في الأرض والله بكل شيء عليم
4628,49,17,"They deem it favor upon you that they have embraced Islam. Say, ""Do not deem your embracing of Islam a favor upon me; rather, it is Allah who has favored you by guiding you to faith, if you are truthful.""","This verse refutes the notion that the disbelievers were doing the Prophet a favor by embracing Islam. Instead, it emphasizes that it is Allah who has favored them by guiding them to the true faith, if they are sincere in their belief. The guidance to faith is a great blessing from Allah, not a favor from the believers to the Prophet.",يمنون عليك أن أسلموا قل لا تمنوا علي إسلامكم بل الله يمن عليكم أن هداكم للإيمان إن كنتم صادقين
4629,49,18,"Indeed, Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do.","This verse highlights Allah's absolute and perfect knowledge of everything that is unseen or hidden from us in the heavens and on earth. It emphasizes that Allah is fully aware of all our actions, intentions, and innermost thoughts, as nothing is concealed from Him. This understanding should instill a sense of accountability and consciousness of Allah's presence in our lives, motivating us to strive for righteousness and seek His pleasure in all our deeds.",إن الله يعلم غيب السماوات والأرض والله بصير بما تعملون

4631,50,2,"But they wondered that a warner had come to them from among themselves, so the disbelievers said, 'This is an amazing thing.'","The disbelievers were amazed and astonished that a warner from among themselves, i.e., the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), had come to them with the message of Islam. They found it strange and unacceptable that one of their own people, whom they knew well, was calling them to abandon their long-held beliefs and practices. Their reaction of dismissing the Prophet's message as ""an amazing thing"" reflects their arrogance and unwillingness to accept the truth.",بل عجبوا أن جاءهم منذر منهم فقال الكافرون هذا شيء عجيب
4632,50,3,"Is it that when we have died and become dust, that is a far return?","This verse questions the disbelief of those who deny the resurrection after death.

4634,50,5,"But they denied the truth when it came to them, so they are in a confused condition.","This verse refers to those who rejected the message of truth brought by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.

4636,50,7,And the earth - We spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein from every delightful pair.,"In this verse, Allah is describing His power and wisdom in creating the earth and making it suitable for life. The interpretation is: ""Allah spread out the earth and made it vast and spacious. He placed firmly set mountains on it to stabilize it and prevent it from shaking.

This underscores Allah's omniscience and that nothing is hidden from Him.",ألم تر أن الله يعلم ما في السماوات وما في الأرض ما يكون من نجوى ثلاثة إلا هو رابعهم ولا خمسة إلا هو سادسهم ولا أدنى من ذلك ولا أكثر إلا هو معهم أين ما كانوا ثم ينبئهم بما عملوا يوم القيامة إن الله بكل شيء عليم
5111,58,8,"Have you not seen those who were forbidden from private conversation, then they revert to what they were forbidden and converse in sin, aggression and disobedience to the Messenger?

Hell will suffice them; they will burn therein, and wretched is the destination.",هذه الآية تنتقد المنافقين الذين كانوا يتناجون ويتحدثون سرًا بأشياء محرمة كالإثم والعدوان وعدم طاعة الرسول، ثم يأتون إلى النبي محمد ويحيونه بطريقة غير لائقة لم يأمر الله بها. ويتساءلون في أنفسهم لماذا لا يعاقبهم الله على ما يقولون من الكفر والنفاق. وتحذرهم الآية بأن جهنم كافية لهم عقابًا، حيث سيصلونها وتكون مصيرهم السيء.,ألم تر إلى الذين نهوا عن النجوى ثم يعودون لما نهوا عنه ويتناجون بالإثم والعدوان ومعصيت الرسول وإذا جاءوك حيوك بما لم يحيك به الله ويقولون في أنفسهم لولا يعذبنا الله بما نقول حسبهم جهنم يصلونها فبئس المصير

5113,58,10,"Secret counsels are only from Shaytan, that he may cause grief to those who believe, though he cannot harm them in the least except by Allah's permission; and on Allah should the believers put their trust.","The interpretation is that private conversations among the believers to conspire against or hurt other believers is a whisper from Satan, whose aim is to cause distress to the believers. However, Satan cannot actually harm the believers except by Allah's permission. Therefore, the believers should put their trust in Allah and avoid such secret counsels that may grieve others.",إنما النجوى من الشيطان ليحزن الذين آمنوا وليس بضارهم شيئا إلا بإذن الله وعلى الله فليتوكل المؤمنون

5115,58,12,"O you who have believed, when you converse privately with the Messenger, present before your private conversation a charity - that is better for you and purer. But if you find not [the means] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","""This verse encourages believers to give charity before engaging in private conversations with the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The act of giving charity purifies one's heart and intentions, making the conversation more blessed and sincere. However, if one cannot afford to give charity, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful towards those who are financially unable.""",يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا ناجيتم الرسول فقدموا بين يدي نجواكم صدقة ذلك خير لكم وأطهر فإن لم تجدوا فإن الله غفور رحيم

It encourages them to give charity if they can, but if they cannot, Allah has pardoned them. However, it emphasizes the importance of establishing prayer, paying the obligatory charity (zakah), and obeying Allah and His Messenger. The verse reminds them that Allah is fully aware of their actions.",أأشفقتم أن تقدموا بين يدي نجواكم صدقات فإذ لم تفعلوا وتاب الله عليكم فأقيموا الصلاة وآتوا الزكاة وأطيعوا الله ورسوله والله خبير بما تعملون

They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood while they know.","This verse warns against allying with or befriending those who have earned Allah's anger, such as disbelievers or hypocrites. It criticizes those who claim to be believers yet ally themselves with Allah's enemies, swearing falsely to prove their loyalty while knowing the truth of their disloyalty.",ألم تر إلى الذين تولوا قوما غضب الله عليهم ما هم منكم ولا منهم ويحلفون على الكذب وهم يعلمون

5120,58,17,Their wealth and their children will never benefit them against Allah. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.,"This verse emphasizes that wealth and offspring, which are highly valued by people, will not benefit the disbelievers on the Day of Judgment.

Unquestionably, it is they who are the liars.","This verse warns about the state of the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection. They will swear to Allah that they were not disbelievers, just as they swear to people in this world, thinking that their oaths will benefit them. However, their oaths will be false, and they are the true liars who denied the truth and the signs of Allah.",يوم يبعثهم الله جميعا فيحلفون له كما يحلفون لكم ويحسبون أنهم على شيء ألا إنهم هم الكاذبون

Unquestionably, the party of Satan - they will be the losers.","This verse warns against being overcome by Satan and forgetting the remembrance of Allah. It states that those who are in Satan's party and have forgotten Allah's remembrance will be the ultimate losers. The interpretation is that one should be vigilant against Satan's deceptions and temptations that lead one away from the remembrance of Allah, as that path leads to loss and ruin in this life and the Hereafter.",استحوذ عليهم الشيطان فأنساهم ذكر الله أولئك حزب الشيطان ألا إن حزب الشيطان هم الخاسرون

The interpretation conveys that Allah's decree is final, and His support for His messengers and the cause of truth is unwavering and unconquerable.",كتب الله لأغلبن أنا ورسلي إن الله قوي عزيز
5125,58,22,"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred.

Allah describes how He expelled these disbelieving Jews from their homes despite their fortresses and strongholds, as a punishment for their hostility towards the Muslims. The Jews had thought their fortresses would protect them, but Allah instilled fear in their hearts, causing them to destroy their own homes before being expelled. This event serves as a lesson and warning for those who have insight to heed.",هو الذي أخرج الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب من ديارهم لأول الحشر ما ظننتم أن يخرجوا وظنوا أنهم مانعتهم حصونهم من الله فأتاهم الله من حيث لم يحتسبوا وقذف في قلوبهم الرعب يخربون بيوتهم بأيديهم وأيدي المؤمنين فاعتبروا يا أولي الأبصار

The phrase ""you did not spur for it any horses or camels"" implies that the Muslims did not expend significant effort or resources in obtaining these conquests. Instead, it was Allah who granted power and authority to His Messenger over those He willed, as He is Omnipotent over all things.",وما أفاء الله على رسوله منهم فما أوجفتم عليه من خيل ولا ركاب ولكن الله يسلط رسله على من يشاء والله على كل شيء قدير

And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","Cette verse traite de la distribution du butin de guerre. Elle stipule que le butin appartient à Allah, au Prophète, à ses proches parents, aux orphelins, aux pauvres et aux voyageurs dans le besoin. Cela vise à empêcher que le butin ne soit accaparé par les riches. Les musulmans doivent obéir aux ordres du Prophète et s'abstenir de ce qu'il a interdit, par crainte d'Allah et de Son châtiment sévère.",ما أفاء الله على رسوله من أهل القرى فلله وللرسول ولذي القربى واليتامى والمساكين وابن السبيل كي لا يكون دولة بين الأغنياء منكم وما آتاكم الرسول فخذوه وما نهاكم عنه فانتهوا واتقوا الله إن الله شديد العقاب

But Allah bears witness that they are liars.","This verse exposes the hypocrisy of some Muslims who claimed to have faith but allied themselves with the disbelievers. They falsely promised their disbelieving brethren that if they were expelled from Medina, the hypocrites would leave with them, disobeying the Prophet. They also vowed to aid the disbelievers if they were attacked, even though aiding disbelievers against Muslims is a grave sin. Allah declares that these hypocrites are liars, as their actions contradict their claims of faith.",ألم تر إلى الذين نافقوا يقولون لإخوانهم الذين كفروا من أهل الكتاب لئن أخرجتم لنخرجن معكم ولا نطيع فيكم أحدا أبدا وإن قوتلتم لننصرنكم والله يشهد إنهم لكاذبون

And if they try to aid them, they will surely turn their backs and flee, then they will not be aided.","This verse refers to the hypocrites who outwardly claimed to be Muslims but inwardly harbored disbelief and enmity towards the believers. It warns that if the believers expel the hypocrites, the hypocrites will not actually leave with them, indicating their lack of true allegiance. If the believers are fought against, the hypocrites will not aid or support them in battle. And if the hypocrites try to aid the believers, they will quickly turn their backs and flee at the first sign of danger, abandoning the believers, and they themselves will not receive any aid or support.",لئن أخرجوا لا يخرجون معهم ولئن قوتلوا لا ينصرونهم ولئن نصروهم ليولن الأدبار ثم لا ينصرون
5138,59,13,For you are more feared in their hearts than Allah. That is because they are a people who do not understand.,The interpretation of this verse is that the disbelievers fear the Muslims more than they fear Allah.

That is because they are a people who do not reason.","This verse describes the cowardly nature of the disbelievers. They lack true courage and unity, and only fight from fortified positions or behind walls. Despite appearing united, their hearts are divided due to their lack of faith and wisdom. Their violence towards each other is severe, reflecting their inner conflicts and lack of guidance. Ultimately, their inability to use reason and logic leads them to this state of disunity and cowardice.",لا يقاتلونكم جميعا إلا في قرى محصنة أو من وراء جدر بأسهم بينهم شديد تحسبهم جميعا وقلوبهم شتى ذلك بأنهم قوم لا يعقلون

Indeed, I fear Allah, Lord of the worlds.""","This verse is a metaphor that likens the situation of those who misguide others to disbelief and then abandon them to the actions of Satan. Satan initially tempts and encourages people to disbelieve, but when they follow his call, he disassociates himself from them, leaving them to face the consequences alone. This demonstrates Satan's deceitful nature and his lack of loyalty or concern for those he misleads. The verse serves as a warning against being misled by Satan and highlights the importance of fearing Allah, the Lord of all worlds, instead of succumbing to Satan's temptations.",كمثل الشيطان إذ قال للإنسان اكفر فلما كفر قال إني بريء منك إني أخاف الله رب العالمين

Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.","This verse is a supplication to Allah, asking Him not to make the believers a means of trial or punishment for the disbelievers, as that would give the disbelievers a chance to mock and ridicule the believers. It also asks Allah to forgive the believers for any shortcomings or sins they may have committed. The verse acknowledges Allah's might and wisdom, affirming that He has the power to grant this supplication and that His decisions are based on perfect wisdom.",ربنا لا تجعلنا فتنة للذين كفروا واغفر لنا ربنا إنك أنت العزيز الحكيم

It encourages emulating the virtuous conduct of the individuals being referred to, as they exemplified true devotion to God and preparation for the Hereafter.

And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.","This verse prohibits Muslims from taking the disbelievers who fought against them for their faith, expelled them from their homes, and assisted in expelling them, as allies or friends. Allying with such oppressive enemies is considered a wrongful act and a transgression against Allah's commands.",إنما ينهاكم الله عن الذين قاتلوكم في الدين وأخرجوكم من دياركم وظاهروا على إخراجكم أن تولوهم ومن يتولهم فأولئك هم الظالمون

It instructs that if Muslim men lose their wives to the disbelievers, but subsequently gain other women who come over from the disbelievers, they should compensate the men whose wives left by paying them an amount equivalent to what they had spent on their wives. This ruling promotes justice and maintains social harmony. It also reminds believers to fear Allah and remain steadfast in their faith.",وإن فاتكم شيء من أزواجكم إلى الكفار فعاقبتم فآتوا الذين ذهبت أزواجهم مثل ما أنفقوا واتقوا الله الذي أنتم به مؤمنون

It establishes the conditions for their pledge, which include not associating partners with Allah, not stealing, not committing adultery, not killing their children, not falsely accusing others of immoral acts, and not disobeying the Prophet in any just matter.
